(For information on what defines a lesser god, see the \"<a href=\"https://5etools-mirror-1.github.io/book.html#DMG,1,divine%20rank,0\">Divine Rank</a>\" sidebar in the <a href=\"https://5etools-mirror-1.github.io/book.html#DMG\">Dungeon Master's Guide</a>.) Auril's beloved ice grasps all things in her clutches, preserving them against the ravages of time. She hoards beauty in all forms, from art objects and flowers to skilled artisans and their wondrous works, freezing them in magical ice for her pleasure alone.</p><p>Auril was aligned with the gods Talos, Umberlee, and Malar. Together they wrought terrible destruction, inspiring fear that compelled tribute to hold their power at bay. Umberlee, queen of the wrathful sea, grew to despise the enduring nature of the ice and snow Auril created. Umberlee seethed when Auril's frigid cold transformed her chaotic, unpredictable tides into rigid, motionless sheets of ice. Umberlee brought Talos and Malar into an alliance against Auril, who retreated to the coldest corner of Toril to escape their fury.</p><p>After a world-shaking event known as the Sundering, most of the gods withdrew from Toril, leaving mortals to govern their own fates without the gods' meddling, but the Frostmaiden could not stay away for long. Auril returned to her icy realm in the far north and, after a time, plunged it into frigid darkness using her magic.</p><p>Casting such great magic night after night while also granting spells to her devoted followers leaves Auril weak and vulnerable. In her self-inflicted weakened state, Auril is inclined to be cautious and avoid contact with other creatures that can harm her.</p><p>Auril's worshipers know better than to disturb her self-imposed isolation. Terrible blizzards have cut off Icewind Dale from the rest of the world, and a shroud of mist conceals her island in the Sea of Moving Ice.</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"126\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Roleplaying Auril</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></span> <p>Portraying a deity, even a lesser god such as Auril the Frostmaiden, can be daunting.

Thus, she has no reason to capitulate to mortals' demands. As the embodiment of winter's cruelty, she is incapable of showing mercy or compassion. Play her as a supremely cold and unfeeling entity.</li><li class=\"rd__li \">Have Auril speak only when necessary. The less she talks, the less risk you have of unintentionally demystifying her in the eyes of your players. Let her actions, not her words, define her.</li><li class=\"rd__li \">Lesser gods in the D&amp;D multiverse are extremely powerful and arrogant, but also fallible and blind to their own flaws. It's appropriate for Auril to act as though she's invincible while underestimating her mortal enemies, even in her current weakened state.</li></ul></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"127\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Lair Actions</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></span> <p>Auril dwells on Solstice, a frozen island hidden among the titanic icebergs in the Sea of Moving Ice.

They are vicious, cruel reptiles driven by hunger and greed.</p><p>A white dragon has feral eyes, a sleek profile, and a spined crest. The scales of a wyrmling white dragon glisten pure white. As the dragon ages, its sheen disappears and some of its scales begin to darken, so that by the time it is old, it is mottled by patches of pale blue and light gray. This patterning helps the dragon blend into the realms of ice and stone in which it hunts, and to fade from view when it soars across a cloud-filled sky.</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"751\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Primal and Vengeful.</span></span> <p>White dragons lack the cunning and tactics of most other dragons. However, their bestial nature makes them the best hunters among all dragonkind, singularly focused on surviving and slaughtering their enemies. A white dragon consumes only food that has been frozen, devouring creatures killed by its breath weapon while they are still stiff and frigid. It encases other kills in ice or buries them in snow near its lair, and finding such a larder is a good indication that a white dragon dwells nearby.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div><p>A white dragon also keeps the bodies of its greatest enemies as trophies, freezing corpses where it can look upon them and gloat. The remains of giants, remorhazes, and other dragons are often positioned prominently within a white dragon's lair as warnings to intruders.</p><p>Though only moderately intelligent, white dragons have extraordinary memories. They recall every slight and defeat, and have been known to conduct malicious vendettas against creatures that have offended them. This often includes silver dragons, which lair in the same territories as whites. White dragons can speak as all dragons can, but they rarely talk unless moved to do so.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"752\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Lone Masters.</span></span> <p>White dragons avoid all other dragons except whites of the opposite sex. Even then, when white dragons seek each other out as mates, they stay together only long enough to conceive offspring before fleeing into isolation again.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div><p>White dragons can't abide rivals near their lairs. As a result, a white dragon attacks other creatures without provocation, viewing such creatures as either too weak or too powerful to live. The only creatures that typically serve a white dragon are intelligent humanoids that demonstrate enough strength to assuage the dragon's wrath, and can put up with sustaining regular losses as a result of its hunger. This includes dragon-worshiping kobolds, which are commonly found in their lairs.</p><p>Powerful creatures can sometimes gain a white dragon's obedience through a demonstration of physical or magical might. Frost giants challenge white dragons to prove their own strength and improve their status in their clans, and their cracked bones litter many a white dragon's lair. However, a white dragon defeated by a frost giant often becomes its servant, accepting the mastery of a superior creature in exchange for asserting its own domination over the other creatures that serve or oppose the giant.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"753\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Treasure Under Ice.</span></span> <p>White dragons love the cold sparkle of ice and favor treasure with similar qualities, particularly diamonds. However, in their remote arctic climes, the treasure hoards of white dragons more often contain walrus and mammoth tusk ivory, whale-bone sculptures, figureheads from ships, furs, and magic items seized from overly bold adventurers.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div><p>Loose coins and gems are spread across a white dragon's lair, glittering like stars when the light strikes them. Larger treasures and chests are encased in layers of rime created by the white dragon's breath, and held safe beneath layers of transparent ice. The dragon's great strength allows it to easily access its wealth, while lesser creatures must spend hours chipping away or melting the ice to reach the dragon's main hoard.</p><p>A white dragon's flawless memory means that it knows how it came to possess every coin, gem, and magic item in its hoard, and it associates each item with a specific victory. White dragons are notoriously difficult to bribe, since any offers of treasure are seen as an insult to their ability to simply slay the creature making the offer and seize the treasure on their own.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"754\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">A White Dragon's Lair.</span></span> <p>White dragons lair in icy caves and deep subterranean chambers far from the sun. They favor high mountain vales accessible only by flying, caverns in cliff faces, and labyrinthine ice caves in glaciers. White dragons love vertical heights in their caverns, flying up to the ceiling to latch on like bats or slithering down icy crevasses.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div><p>A legendary white dragon's innate magic deepens the cold in the area around its lair. Mountain caverns are fast frozen by the white dragon's presence. A white dragon can often detect intruders by the way the keening wind in its lair changes tone.</p><p>A white dragon rests on high ice shelves and cliffs in its lair, the floor around it a treacherous morass of broken ice and stone, hidden pits, and slippery slopes. As foes struggle to move toward it, the dragon flies from perch to perch and destroys them with its freezing breath.</p></div></div></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"755\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Chromatic Dragons</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></span> <p>The black, blue, green, red, and white dragons represent the evil side of dragonkind.

Trying to humble a chromatic dragon is like trying to convince the wind to stop blowing. To these creatures, humanoids are animals, fit to serve as prey or beasts of burden, and wholly unworthy of respect.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"758\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Dangerous Lairs</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></span> <p>A dragon's lair serves as the seat of its power and a vault for its treasure. With its innate toughness and tolerance for severe environmental effects, a dragon selects or builds a lair not for shelter but for defense, favoring multiple entrances and exits, and security for its hoard.</p><p>Most chromatic dragon lairs are hidden in dangerous and remote locations to prevent all but the most audacious mortals from reaching them. A black dragon might lair in the heart of a vast swamp, while a red dragon might claim the caldera of an active volcano. In addition to the natural defenses of their lairs, powerful chromatic dragons use magical guardians, traps, and subservient creatures to protect their treasures.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"759\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Queen of Evil Dragons</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></span> <p>Tiamat the Dragon Queen is the chief deity of evil dragonkind. She dwells on Avernus, the first layer of the Nine Hells. As a lesser god, Tiamat has the power to grant spells to her worshipers, though she is loath to share her power. She epitomizes the avarice of evil dragons, believing that the multiverse and all its treasures will one day be hers and hers alone.</p><p>Tiamat is a gigantic dragon whose five heads reflect the forms of the chromatic dragons that worship her-black, blue, green, red, and white. She is a terror on the battlefield, capable of annihilating whole armies with her five breath weapons, her formidable spellcasting, and her fearsome claws.</p><p>Tiamat's most hated enemy is Bahamut the Platinum Dragon, with whom she shares control of the faith of dragonkind. She also holds a special enmity for Asmodeus, who long ago stripped her of the rule of Avernus and who continues to curb the Dragon Queen's power.</p></div></div><p>True dragons are winged reptiles of ancient lineage and fearsome power. They are known and feared for their predatory cunning and greed, with the oldest dragons accounted as some of the most powerful creatures in the world. Dragons are also magical creatures whose innate power fuels their dreaded breath weapons and other preternatural abilities.</p><p>Many creatures, including wyverns and dragon turtles, have draconic blood. However, true dragons fall into the two broad categories of chromatic and metallic dragons. The black, blue, green, red, and white dragons are selfish, evil, and feared by all. The brass, bronze, copper, gold, and silver dragons are noble, good, and highly respected by the wise.</p><p>Though their goals and ideals vary tremendously, all true dragons covet wealth, hoarding mounds of coins and gathering gems, jewels, and magic items. Dragons with large hoards are loath to leave them for long, venturing out of their lairs only to patrol or feed.</p><p>True dragons pass through four distinct stages of life, from lowly wyrmlings to ancient dragons, which can live for over a thousand years. In that time, their might can become unrivaled and their hoards can grow beyond price.</p><p>Dragon Age Categories</p><table class=\"rd__table  stripe-odd-table\"><thead><tr><th class=\"col-4\" data-rd-isroller=\"false\">Category</th><th class=\"col-4\" data-rd-isroller=\"false\">Size</th><th class=\"col-4\" data-rd-isroller=\"false\">Age Range</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class=\"col-4\">Wyrmling</td><td class=\"col-4\">Medium</td><td class=\"col-4\">5 years or less</td></tr><tr><td class=\"col-4\">Young</td><td class=\"col-4\">Large</td><td class=\"col-4\">6–100 years</td></tr><tr><td class=\"col-4\">Adult</td><td class=\"col-4\">Huge</td><td class=\"col-4\">101–800 years</td></tr><tr><td class=\"col-4\">Ancient</td><td class=\"col-4\">Gargantuan</td><td class=\"col-4\">801 years or more</td></tr></tbody></table><div class=\"rd__b-special rd__b-inset \" data-source=\"FTD\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2-inset\" data-title-index=\"746\"><span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Customizing Dragons</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"> <span class=\"rd__title-link rd__title-link--inset\"><span class=\"help-subtle\" title=\"Fizban’s Treasury of Dragons\">FTD</span> p33</span><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-special-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></span><p>You can customize any dragon's stat block to reflect the dragon's unique character.

The war among elvenkind ended when the good elves banished their malevolent kin to the subterranean depths. Here, in the lightless caverns and endless warrens of twisting passages, the dark elves-the drow-found refuge. They also found leadership in the only elven deity who had not forsaken them. At her command, the dark elves built an empire in the underworld.</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"547\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Children of Lolth.</span></span> <p>The drow worship Lolth, a deity who resides in the Abyss. Known as the Spider Queen or the Demon Queen of Spiders, she is the figure around which the dark elves have built their subterranean civilization. Whatever she demands, the drow do. The wickedest of elves, drow are seldom seen by the surface world. Though they plot to destroy the elves that banished them, they no longer see themselves as exiles. They are the destined rulers of the darkness, and when Lolth commands them to rise up and destroy their surface-dwelling kin, they will.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div></div><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"548\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Creatures of Darkness.</span></span> <p>The drow have lived underground for so long that they have evolved to their surroundings and can see in the dark. However, they can no longer stand sunlight. When slaves are in short supply in the Underdark, the drow send raiding parties to the surface to capture humanoids under cover of darkness, bringing them back to their cities to be tortured into submission. Beyond those occasional excursions, the drow are content to remain in their subterranean realm, where they feel secure and in control.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"549\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Underdark Cities.</span></span> <p>The dark elves build fantastic cities in enormous caverns where food and water are abundant. Their ability to sculpt stone rivals that of the greatest dwarf artisans, yet their structures retain a decidedly elven aesthetic. Though appearing delicate, drow settlements are structurally sound and remarkably resilient. The drow like to hollow out enormous stalagmites and stalactites, creating populated spires that rise from the floors and ceilings. A drow city is a sprawling metropolis enclosed by high walls. Non-drow visitors must conduct their business outside the walls under watchful eyes. The drow raise and keep giant spiders to help protect their cities against intruders, even as they drape those cities in beautiful webbing, creating a gossamer snare to catch flying enemies that would otherwise soar over the walls.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"550\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Drow Magic.</span></span> <p>Just as the drow have adapted to underground life, so too has their magic. In addition to using that magic to carve their cities from stone, they empower their weapons, create dangerous new magic items, and summon demons from the Abyss. Drow spellcasters are supremely arrogant and never hesitate to use their magic in the most abhorrent ways.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"551\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Arms and Armor.</span></span> <p>Drow craft weapons made of adamantine, a dark and supernaturally hard metal. Drow artisans adorn their weapons and armor with web-like filigree and spider motifs, and mages sometimes imbue items with magic to enhance their effectiveness. However, such magic fades when exposed to sunlight, so that magical drow weapons and armor rarely retain their enhancement bonuses and magical properties when brought to the surface.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"552\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Cutthroat Politics.</span></span> <p>Drow politics are cutthroat and rife with intrigue. When drow work together, it is typically to destroy a common foe and ensure their own survival, and such alliances are short lived and fraught with peril.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div><p>Drow society is divided into noble houses, each ruled by a matron who seeks to raise the prestige and power of her house above all others. Other high-ranking members of the house are blood relatives, while the middling ranks are flush with drow from weaker families that have sworn fealty to the greater house. Clinging precariously to the bottom rung of a house's social ladder are the house slaves, made up of drow of low birth and the occasional non-drow captive.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"553\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Matriarchal Rule.</span></span> <p>Lolth, through her faithful priestesses, dictates the rules of drow society, ensuring that her orders and plots are carried out. Since Lolth is prone to manifesting on the Material Plane and directly punishing those that disobey her, the drow have learned to heed what she says and do as her priestesses command.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div><p>In drow society, males are subservient to females. A male drow might lead an Underdark patrol or a raiding party to the surface, but he reports to a female drow-either the matron of his house or one of her hand-picked female subordinates. Although male drow can fill almost any function in drow society, they can't be priests, nor can they rule a house.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"554\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Poison Predilection.</span></span> <p>Distilled from spider venom and the flora of the Underdark, poison can be found in abundance among the drow, and it plays an important part in their culture and politics.

One group of them uncovered a buried tower in the tundra (see \"Lost Spire of Netheril\"), and Dzaan went out of his way to eliminate anyone who knew of it, including the adventurers who found it and several Ten-Towners with whom they had spoken. After turning the tower into his secret base, Dzaan visited Easthaven to gather supplies. Although he took the precaution of adopting a magical disguise, members of the local militia recognized Dzaan by the way he walked and spoke. They captured him, gagged him, confiscated his spellbook, and condemned him to death.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div><p>The characters have no opportunity to speak with Dzaan.

It uses its remaining spell slots sparingly.</p><p>The sunken Netherese tower contains a special room that can transform the simulacrum into a real person—or any magical illusion into the real thing, for that matter.

He then cast it adrift in Limbo, believing that the stone would bring order to the chaos of that plane and halt the spread of chaos to other planes. As the stone's power grew, it became possible for creatures with ordered minds, such as modrons and githzerai, to create enclaves in Limbo. However, Primus's creation had an unforeseen side effect: the chaotic energy absorbed by the stone spawned the horrors that came to be known as slaadi. Sages refer to Primus's massive creation as the Spawning Stone for this reason.</p><p>The slaadi wiped out every last modron enclave in Limbo. As creatures of utter chaos, slaadi loathe modrons and attack them on sight.

They further their own power at any cost, having no interest in the affairs of the living except where those affairs interfere with their own. Scheming and insane, they hunger for long-forgotten knowledge and the most terrible secrets. Because the shadow of death doesn't hang over them, they can conceive plans that take years, decades, or centuries to come to fruition.</p><p>A lich is a gaunt and skeletal humanoid with withered flesh stretched tight across its bones. Its eyes succumbed to decay long ago, but points of light burn in its empty sockets. It is often garbed in the moldering remains of fine clothing and jewelry worn and dulled by the passage of time.</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"696\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Secrets of Undeath.</span></span> <p>No wizard takes up the path to lichdom on a whim, and the process of becoming a lich is a well-guarded secret. Wizards that seek lichdom must make bargains with fiends, evil gods, or other foul entities. Many turn to Orcus, Demon Prince of Undeath, whose power has created countless liches. However, those that control the power of lichdom always demand fealty and service for their knowledge.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div><p>A lich is created by an arcane ritual that traps the wizard's soul within a phylactery. Doing so binds the soul to the mortal world, preventing it from traveling to the Outer Planes after death. A phylactery is traditionally an amulet in the shape of a small box, but it can take the form of any item possessing an interior space into which arcane sigils of naming, binding, immortality, and dark magic are scribed in silver.</p><p>With its phylactery prepared, the future lich drinks a potion of transformation-a vile concoction of poison mixed with the blood of a sentient creature whose soul is sacrificed to the phylactery. The wizard falls dead, then rises as a lich as its soul is drawn into the phylactery, where it forever remains.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"697\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Soul Sacrifices.</span></span> <p>A lich must periodically feed souls to its phylactery to sustain the magic preserving its body and consciousness. It does this using the @spell[imprisonment] spell. Instead of choosing one of the normal options of the spell, the lich uses the spell to magically trap the target's body and soul inside its phylactery. The phylactery must be on the same plane as the lich for the spell to work. A lich's phylactery can hold only one creature at a time, and a dispel magic cast as a 9th-level spell upon the phylactery releases any creature imprisoned within it. A creature imprisoned in the phylactery for 24 hours is consumed and destroyed utterly, whereupon nothing short of divine intervention can restore it to life.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div><p>A lich that fails or forgets to maintain its body with sacrificed souls begins to physically fall apart, and might eventually become a demilich.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"698\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Death and Restoration.</span></span> <p>When a lich's body is broken by accident or assault, the will and mind of the lich drains from it, leaving only a lifeless corpse behind. Within days, a new body reforms next to the lich's phylactery, coalescing out of glowing smoke that issues from the device. Because the destruction of its phylactery means the possibility of eternal death, a lich usually keeps its phylactery in a hidden, well-guarded location.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div><p>Destroying a lich's phylactery is no easy task and often requires a special ritual, item, or weapon. Every phylactery is unique, and discovering the key to its destruction can be a quest in and of itself.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"699\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Lonely Existence.</span></span> <p>From time to time, a lich might be stirred from its single-minded pursuit of power to take an interest in the world around it, most often when some great event reminds it of the life it once led.

Alternatively, some liches construct secret tombs filled with powerful guardians and traps.

Unlocking this knowledge can take years, even decades.</p></div></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--0\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--0\" data-title-index=\"672\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Slaadi</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></span> <p>In the Ever-Changing Chaos of Limbo, bits of forest and meadow, ruined castles, and isolated islands drift through a tumult of fire, water, earth, and wind. The foremost inhabitants of this inhospitable plane are the toad-like slaadi. Slaadi are undisciplined and have no formal hierarchy, although weaker slaadi obey stronger ones under threat of annihilation.</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"673\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">The Spawning Stone</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></span> <p> Long ago, Primus, overlord of the modrons, created a gigantic, geometrically complex stone imbued with the power of law. He then cast it adrift in Limbo, believing that the stone would bring order to the chaos of that plane and halt the spread of chaos to other planes. As the stone's power grew, it became possible for creatures with ordered minds, such as modrons and githzerai, to create enclaves in Limbo. However, Primus's creation had an unforeseen side effect: the chaotic energy absorbed by the stone spawned the horrors that came to be known as slaadi. Sages refer to Primus's massive creation as the Spawning Stone for this reason.</p><p>The slaadi wiped out every last modron enclave in Limbo. As creatures of utter chaos, slaadi loathe modrons and attack them on sight. Nonetheless, Primus stands by his creation and either doesn't perceive the slaadi as threats or chooses to ignore them.</p><div class=\"rd__b-special rd__b-inset \"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2-inset\" data-title-index=\"674\"><span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Variant: Slaad Control Gems</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-special-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></span><p>As a slaad emerges from the Spawning Stone, the stone magically implants a fragment of itself in the slaad's brain. This fragment takes the form of a magic gem roughly the size and shape of a human child's fist. The gem is the same color as the slaad. Another creature can use magic to draw forth a slaad's gem and use it to subjugate the slaad. The slaad must obey whoever possesses its gem. If a slaad's gem is destroyed, the slaad can no longer be controlled in this way.</p><p>A slaad born from something other than the Spawning Stone has no gem in its brain, but it gains one if it ever comes into contact with the Spawning Stone. Slaadi on Limbo are attracted to the Spawning Stone, so most end up with a gem.

This aspect demands an additional sacrifice: one of the orc's eyes, symbolizing the loss Gruumsh suffered at the hands of his greatest enemy, Corellon Larethian.</p><p>If the orc plucks out one of its eyes, Gruumsh might grant the orc spellcasting ability and special favor, along with the right to call itself an Eye of Gruumsh. When not using their auguries to advise their war chiefs, these savage devotees of the god of slaughter hurl themselves into battle, their weapons stained with blood.</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"324\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Orcs.</span></span> <p>Orcs are savage raiders and pillagers with stooped postures, low foreheads, and piggish faces with prominent lower canines that resemble tusks.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"325\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Gruumsh One-Eye.</span></span> <p> Orcs worship Gruumsh, the mightiest of the orc deities and their creator. The orcs believe that in ancient days, the gods gathered to divide the world among their followers. When Gruumsh claimed the mountains, he learned they had been taken by the dwarves. He laid claim to the forests, but those had been settled by the elves. Each place that Gruumsh wanted had already been claimed. The other gods laughed at Gruumsh, but he responded with a furious bellow. Grasping his mighty spear, he laid waste to the mountains, set the forests aflame, and carved great furrows in the fields. Such was the role of the orcs, he proclaimed, to take and destroy all that the other races would deny them. To this day, the orcs wage an endless war on humans, elves, dwarves, and other folk.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div><p>Orcs hold a particular hatred for elves. The elven god Corellon Larethian half-blinded Gruumsh with a well-placed arrow to the orc god's eye. Since then, the orcs have taken particular joy in slaughtering elves. Turning his injury into a baleful gift, Gruumsh grants divine might to any champion who willingly plucks out one of its eyes in his honor.</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"326\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Tribes like Plagues.</span></span> <p>Orcs gather in tribes that exert their dominance and satisfy their bloodlust by plundering villages, devouring or driving off roaming herds, and slaying any humanoids that stand against them. After savaging a settlement, orcs pick it clean of wealth and items usable in their own lands. They set the remains of villages and camps ablaze, then retreat whence they came, their bloodlust satisfied.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div><p>When an existing territory is depleted of food, an orc tribe divides into roving bands that scout for choice hunting grounds. When each party returns, it brings back trophies and news of targets ripe for attack, the richest of which is chosen. The tribe then sets out en masse to carve a bloody path to its new territory.</p><p>On rare occasions, a tribe's leader chooses to hold onto a particularly defensible lair for decades. The orcs of such a tribe must range far across the countryside to sate their appetites.</p><p>Strength and power are the greatest of orcish virtues, and orcs embrace all manner of mighty creatures in their tribes. Rejecting notions of racial purity, they proudly welcome ogres, trolls, half-orcs, and orogs into their ranks. As well, orcs respect and fear the size and power of evil giants, and often serve them as guards and soldiers.</p></div></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"327\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Ranging Scavengers.</span></span> <p> Their lust for slaughter demands that orcs dwell always within striking distance of new targets. As such, they seldom settle permanently, instead converting ruins, cavern complexes, and defeated foes' villages into fortified camps and strongholds. Orcs build only for defense, making no innovation or improvement to their lairs beyond mounting the severed body parts of their victims on spiked stockade walls or pikes jutting up from moats and trenches.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"328\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Leadership and Might.</span></span> <p> Orc tribes are mostly patriarchal, flaunting such vivid or grotesque titles as Many-Arrows, Screaming Eye, and Elf Ripper.

The orcs' drive to reproduce runs stronger than any other humanoid race, and they readily crossbreed with other races. When an orc procreates with a non-orc humanoid of similar size and stature (such as a human or a dwarf), the resulting child is either an orc or a half-orc. When an orc produces young with an ogre, the child is a half-ogre of intimidating strength and brutish features called an ogrillon.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div></div></div></div></div>","public":""},"alignment":"chaotic evil","race":"","type":{"value":"humanoid","subtype":"orc","swarm":null,"custom":""},"environment":"Arctic, Forest, Grassland, Hill, Mountain, Swamp, Underdark","cr":2,"spellLevel":3,"xp":{"value":450},"source":"MM","class":{"level":3,"name":"cleric"}},"traits":{"size":"med","di":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dr":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dv":{"value":[],"custom":""},"ci":{"value":[],"custom":""},"languages":{"value":["common","orc"],"custom":""}},"currency":{"pp":0,"gp":0,"ep":0,"sp":0,"cp":0},"skills":{"acr":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"ani":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"arc":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"ath":{"value":0,"ability":"str","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"dec":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"his":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"ins":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"itm":{"value":1,"ability":"cha","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"inv":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"med":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"nat":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"prc":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"prf":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"per":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"rel":{"value":1,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"slt":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"ste":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"sur":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}}},"spells":{"spell1":{"value":4,"override":null,"max":4},"spell2":{"value":2,"override":null,"max":2},"spell3":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell4":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell5":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell6":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell7":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell8":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell9":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"pact":{"value":0,"override":null},"spell0":{"value":0,"max":0}},"bonuses":{"mwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"msak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rsak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"abilities":{"check":"","save":"","skill":""},"spell":{"dc":""}},"resources":{"legact":{"value":0,"max":0},"legres":{"value":0,"max":0},"lair":{"value":false,"initiative":20}}},"ownership":{"default":0,"PP5XOkXk6hNdYKV4":3},"prototypeToken":{"name":"Orc Eye of Gruumsh","displayName":20,"actorLink":false,"width":1,"height":1,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"alpha":1,"light":{"alpha":0.5,"angle":360,"bright":0,"coloration":1,"dim":0,"luminosity":0.5,"saturation":0,"contrast":0,"shadows":0,"animation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5,"reverse":false,"type":null},"darkness":{"min":0,"max":1},"attenuation":0.5,"color":null},"disposition":-1,"displayBars":40,"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.hp"},"bar2":{"attribute":null},"flags":{},"randomImg":false,"texture":{"src":"assets/srd5e/img/MM/Orc Eye of Gruumsh.png","scaleX":1,"scaleY":1,"offsetX":0,"offsetY":0,"rotation":0,"tint":null},"sight":{"angle":360,"enabled":true,"range":60,"brightness":0,"visionMode":"basic","color":null,"attenuation":0.1,"saturation":0,"contrast":0},"detectionModes":[]},"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.0.1","coreVersion":"10.284","createdTime":null,"modifiedTime":1662383860525,"lastModifiedBy":"PP5XOkXk6hNdYKV4"}}

A hag might fly in a magical giant's skull, landing it on a tree shaped to resemble an enormous headless body.

The only parts of the dragon not forged from chardalyn are its wing flaps, which are made of an oily film as tough as rubber, and its heart, which is an orb of pulsating, radiant energy. Demonic magic suffusing the chardalyn imbues the construct with malevolence, allowing it to enjoy the terror it causes. This effect extends outward from it, corrupting other creatures who get too close to the dragon.

Its strangest feature is its shadow, which appears humanoid rather than reflecting the creature's physical form. Sages postulate that the first perytons were humans transformed by a hideous curse or magical experiment, but bards tell a different tale of a man whose infidelity caused his scorned wife to cut out the heart of her younger, more beautiful rival and consume it in a ritual intended to forever win her husband's heart. The ritual succeeded until the woman's villainy was exposed. She was hanged for her crime, but the lingering magic of her foul ritual caused the carrion birds that feasted on her corpse to transform into the first perytons.</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"351\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Unnatural Hunger.</span></span> <p>A peryton's reproductive cycle depends on the heart of a freshly killed humanoid. The organ must be consumed by a female peryton before she can reproduce. When a peryton consumes a heart, its shadow changes for a brief time to reflect its true monstrous form. When attacking a humanoid, a peryton is single-minded and relentless, fighting until it or its prey dies.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div><p>If a peryton is somehow driven away, it stalks lost prey from afar, attacking again when the opportunity arises.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"352\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Bane of the Mountains.</span></span> <p>Perytons roost atop mountain ridges and lair in high caves.

Nass and Zelenn's relationship started off well, but in recent years it has become painfully obvious to Zelenn that Nass has been slow to master the arcane tradition of divination. Zelenn's suggestion that Nass leave the Hosttower of the Arcane and gain experience abroad left Nass feeling unwanted. After much thought, however, Nass came around to the idea. She could put her magic to the test and carve out a name for herself.</p><p>As she was preparing to leave the Hosttower, Nass overheard her master talking to another wizard about a covert expedition to Icewind Dale being undertaken to seek out long-lost magic from a bygone empire. Rather than carry out her original plan, Nass followed her fellow wizards to Icewind Dale. She caught up to them in Bryn Shander and made her presence known, claiming she was sent by her master to aid the expedition with her divinations. Egos and frayed nerves caused the group to split up shortly thereafter, with each wizard determined to succeed alone.</p><p>One night while the others slept, Nass stole a @item[Professor Skant|IDRotF|professor orb] (see <a href=\"https://5etools-mirror-1.github.io/adventure.html#IDRotF,22,%7b%40item%20professor%20orb%7cwdmm%7d,0\">appendix D</a>) from one of her fellow wizards, Vellynne Harpell. Two of Vellynne's kobold companions witnessed the theft, and Nass killed them with @spell[Melf's acid arrow] spells before fleeing with the orb.</p><p>Nass fled Ten-Towns and headed toward the Sea of Moving Ice, hoping to find a tome called @item[The Codicil of White|IDRotF], a book of magic and lore composed by servants of Auril the Frostmaiden. The Arcane Brotherhood believes that this book tells how to reach a lost city of magic entombed in the ice. Before she could obtain the book, Nass perished. She now exists as a ghost, unable to rest until she finds the book. Characters who come upon Nass's frozen remains also find her spellbook and the orb she stole from Vellynne.</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"100\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Familiar.</span></span> <p>Nass's magical familiar, a white arctic weasel acclimated to cold weather named Zelennor, watches over the wizard's frozen remains.

The shadow of the Nine Hells of Baator extends far across the multiverse, and Asmodeus, the dark lord of Nessus, strives to subjugate the cosmos to satisfy his thirst for power.

Devils on the Material Plane use their influence to manipulate humanoid rulers, whispering evil thoughts, fomenting paranoia, and eventually driving them to tyrannical actions.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"149\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Obedience and Ambition.</span></span> <p>In accordance with their lawful alignment, devils obey even when they envy or dislike their superiors, knowing that their obedience will be rewarded. The hierarchy of the Nine Hells depends on this unswerving loyalty, without which that fiendish plane would become as anarchic as the Abyss.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div><p>At the same time, it is in the nature of devils to scheme, creating in some a desire to rule that eclipses their contentment to be ruled. This singular ambition is strongest among the archdevils whom Asmodeus appoints to rule the nine layers of the Nine Hells. These high-ranking fiends are the only devils to ever sample true power, which they crave like the sweetest ambrosia.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"150\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Dark Dealers and Soul Mongers.</span></span> <p>Devils are confined to the Lower Planes, but they can travel beyond those planes by way of portals or powerful summoning magic. They love to strike bargains with mortals seeking to gain some benefit or prize, but a mortal making such a bargain must be wary. Devils are crafty negotiators and positively ruthless at enforcing the terms of an agreement. Moreover, a contract with even the lowliest devil is enforced by Asmodeus's will. Any mortal creature that breaks such a contract instantly forfeits its soul, which is spirited away to the Nine Hells.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div><p>To own a creature's soul is to have absolute control over that creature, and most devils accept no other currency in exchange for the fiendish power and boons they can provide. A soul is usually forfeited when a mortal dies naturally, for devils are immortal and can wait years for a contract to play out. If a contract allows a devil to claim a mortal's soul before death, it can instantly return to the Nine Hells with the soul in its possession. Only divine intervention can release a soul after a devil has claimed it.</p></div></div></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"151\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">The Infernal Hierarchy</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></span> <div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><p>The Nine Hells has a rigid hierarchy that defines every aspect of its society. Asmodeus is the supreme ruler of all devils, and the only creature in the Nine Hells with the powers of a lesser god. Worshiped as such in the Material Plane, Asmodeus inspires the evil humanoid cults that take his name. In the Nine Hells, he commands scores of pit fiend generals, which in turn command legions of subordinates.</p><p>A supreme tyrant, a brilliant deceiver, and a master of subtlety, Asmodeus protects his throne by keeping his friends close and his enemies closer. He delegates most matters of rulership to the pit fiends and lesser archdevils that make up the infernal bureaucracy of the Nine Hells, even as he knows that those powerful devils conspire to usurp the Throne of Baator from which he rules. Asmodeus appoints archdevils, and he can strip any member of the infernal hierarchy of rank and status as he likes.</p><p>If it dies outside the Nine Hells, a devil disappears in a cloud of sulfurous smoke or dissolves into a pool of ichor, instantly returning to its home layer, where it reforms at full strength.

Archdevils and greater devils have the power to promote lemures to lesser devils. Archdevils can promote lesser devils to greater devils, and Asmodeus alone can promote a greater devil to archdevil status. This diabolic promotion invokes a brief, painful transformation, with the devil's memories passing intact from one form to the next.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div><p>Low-level promotions are typically based on need, such as when a pit fiend transforms lemures into imps to gain invisible spies under its command. High-level promotions are almost always based on merit, such as when a bone devil that distinguishes itself in battle is transformed into a horned devil by the archdevil it serves. A devil is seldom promoted more than one step at a time in the hierarchy of infernal forms.</p><p>Demotion is the customary punishment for failure or disobedience among the devils. Archdevils or greater devils can demote a lesser devil to a lemure, which loses all memory of its prior existence. An archdevil can demote a greater devil to lesser devil status, but the demoted devil retains its memories-and might seek vengeance if the severity of the demotion is excessive.</p><p>No devil can promote or demote another devil that has not sworn fealty to it, preventing rival archdevils from demoting each other's most powerful servants. Since all devils swear fealty to Asmodeus, he can freely demote any other devil, transforming it into whatever infernal form he desires.</p><table class=\"rd__table  stripe-odd-table\"><caption>Infernal Hierarchy</caption><thead><tr><th class=\"col-4\" data-rd-isroller=\"false\">Rank</th><th class=\"col-8\" data-rd-isroller=\"false\">Devil(s)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class=\"col-4\">1.</td><td class=\"col-8\">lemure</td></tr><tr><td class=\"col-4\">2.

The most expeditious means of doing so is the River Styx, which plunges ever deeper as it flows from one layer to the next.

(Ogres don't mate with dwarves, halflings, or elves. They eat them.) Human mothers rarely survive the birth of a half-ogre offspring.</p><p>The half-ogre offspring of an ogre and an orc is also called an ogrillon. An adult half-ogre or ogrillon stands 8 feet tall and weighs 450 pounds on average.</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"344\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Ogres.</span></span> <p>Ogres are as lazy of mind as they are strong of body. They live by raiding, scavenging, and killing for food and pleasure. The average adult specimen stands between 9 and 10 feet tall and weighs close to a thousand pounds.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"345\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Furious Tempers.</span></span> <p> Ogres are notorious for their quick tempers, which flare at the smallest perceived offense. Insults and name-calling can rouse an ogre's wrath in an instant-as can stealing from it, bumping, jabbing, or prodding it, laughing, making faces, or simply looking at it the wrong way. When its rage is incited, an ogre lashes out in a frustrated tantrum until it runs out of objects or creatures to smash.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div><p>An ogre sleeps in caves, animal dens, or under trees until it finds a cabin or isolated farmhouse, whereupon it kills the inhabitants and lairs there. Whenever it is bored or hungry, an ogre ventures out from its lair, attacking anything that crosses its path. Only after an ogre has depleted an area of food does it move on.</p><p>Whenever possible, ogres gang up with other monsters to bully or prey on creatures weaker than themselves. They associate freely with goblinoids, orcs, and trolls, and practically worship giants. In the giants' complex social structure (known as the ordning), ogres rank beneath the lowest giants in status. As a result, an ogre will do nearly anything a giant asks.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"346\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Gruesome Gluttons.</span></span> <p> Ogres eat almost anything, but they especially enjoy the taste of dwarves, halflings, and elves. When they can, they combine dinner with pleasure, chasing scurrying victims around before eating them raw. If enough of its victim remains after the ogre has gorged itself, it might make a loincloth from its quarry's skin and a necklace from its leftover bones. This macabre crafting is the height of ogre culture.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"347\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Greedy Collectors.</span></span> <p> An ogre's eyes glitter with avarice when it sees the possessions of others. Ogres carry rough sacks on their raids, which they fill with fabulous \"treasure\" taken from their victims. This might include a collection of battered helmets, a moldy wheel of cheese, a rough patch of animal fur fastened like a cloak, or a squealing, mud-spattered pig. Ogres also delight in the gleam of gold and silver, and they will fight one another over small handfuls of coins. Smarter creatures can earn an ogre's trust by offering it gold or a weapon forged for a creature of its size.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"348\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Legendary Stupidity.</span></span> <p> Few ogres can count to ten, even with their fingers in front of them. Most speak only a rudimentary form of Giant and know a smattering of Common words. Ogres believe what they are told and are easy to fool or confuse, but they break things they don't understand. Silver-tongued tricksters who test their talents on these savages typically end up eating their eloquent words-and then being eaten in turn.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"349\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Primitive Wanderers.</span></span> <p> Ogres clothe themselves in animal pelts and uproot trees for use as crude tools and weapons. They create stone-tipped javelins for hunting. When they establish lairs, they settle near the rural edges of civilized lands, taking advantage of poorly protected livestock, undefended larders, and unwary farmers.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"350\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Ogre Gangs.</span></span> <p> Ogres sometimes band together in small, nomadic groups, but they lack a true sense of tribalism.

They do so to gain the trust of creatures with whom they negotiate, replacing jackal snarls with winsome smiles.

They act as mercenaries and are notorious for their shifting loyalties. They are the embodiments of avarice.

It is widely believed that Asmodeus, Lord of the Nine Hells, commissioned the work, in the hope of creating an army of fiends that were not bound to the Nine Hells. In the course of making this new army, the hags crafted four magic tomes and recorded the true names of every yugoloth they created, save one, the General of Gehenna. These tomes were called the Books of Keeping. Since knowing a fiend's true name grants power over it, the hags used the books to ensure the yugoloths' loyalty. They also used the books to capture the true names of other fiends that crossed them. It is rumored that the Books of Keeping contain the true names of a few demon lords and archdevils as well.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div><p>Petty jealousies and endless bickering caused the sisterhood to dissolve, and in the ensuing power grab, the Books of Keeping were lost or stolen.

Being self-serving creatures, yugoloths quarrel among themselves constantly. A yugoloth army is more organized than a ravening horde of demons, but far less orderly and regimented than a legion of devils. Without a powerful leader to keep them in line, yugoloths fight simply to indulge their violent predilections, and only as long as it benefits them to do so.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"634\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Back to Gehenna.</span></span> <p>When a yugoloth dies, it dissolves into a pool of ichor and reforms at full strength on the Bleak Eternity of Gehenna. Only on its native plane can a yugoloth be destroyed permanently. A yugoloth knows this and acts accordingly. When summoned to other planes, a yugoloth fights without concern for its own well-being. On Gehenna, it is more apt to retreat or plead for mercy if its demise seems imminent.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div><p>When a yugoloth is permanently destroyed, its name vanishes from every Book of Keeping.

Each Book of Keeping still exists, drifting from plane to plane, where the brave and the foolish occasionally stumble upon them. A yugoloth summoned using its true name, as inscribed in the Books of Keeping, is forced to serve its summoner obediently. The yugoloth hates being controlled in this manner and isn't shy about making its displeasure known.

class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><p>The mightiest of the golems, the iron golem is a massive, towering giant wrought of heavy metal. An iron golem's shape can be worked into any form, though most are fashioned to look like giant suits of armor. Its fist can destroy creatures with a single blow, and its clanging steps shake the earth beneath its feet. Iron golems wield enormous blades to extend their reach, and all can belch clouds of deadly poison.</p><p>An iron golem's body is smelted with rare tinctures and admixtures. Though other golems bear weaknesses inherent in their materials or the power of the elemental spirit bound within them, iron golems were designed to be nearly invulnerable. Their iron bodies imprison the spirits that drive them, and are susceptible only to weapons imbued with magic or the strength of adamantine.</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"659\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Golems.</span></span> <p>Golems are made from humble materials-clay, flesh and bones, iron, or stone-but they possess astonishing power and durability. A golem has no ambitions, needs no sustenance, feels no pain, and knows no remorse. An unstoppable juggernaut, it exists to follow its creator's orders, and it protects or attacks as that creator demands.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div><p>To create a golem, one requires a manual of golems (see the Dungeon Master's Guide). The comprehensive illustrations and instructions in a manual detail the process for creating a golem of a particular type.</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"660\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Elemental Spirit in Material Form.</span></span> <p> The construction of a golem begins with the building of its body, requiring great command of the craft of sculpting, stonecutting, ironworking, or surgery. Sometimes a golem's creator is the master of the art, but often the individual who desires a golem must enlist master artisans to do the work.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div><p>After constructing the body from clay, flesh, iron, or stone, the golem's creator infuses it with a spirit from the Elemental Plane of Earth. This tiny spark of life has no memory, personality, or history. It is simply the impetus to move and obey. This process binds the spirit to the artificial body and subjects it to the will of the golem's creator.</p><p>A golem can be created with a special amulet or other item that allows the possessor of the item to control the golem. Golems whose creators are long dead can thus be harnessed to serve a new master.</p><p>A golem can't think or act for itself. Though it understands its commands perfectly, it has no grasp of language beyond that understanding, and can't be reasoned with or tricked with words.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"661\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Ageless Guardians.</span></span> <p> Golems can guard sacred sites, tombs, and treasure vaults long after the deaths of their creators, carrying out their appointed tasks for all eternity while brushing off physical damage and ignoring all but the most potent spells.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"662\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Blind Obedience.</span></span> <p> When its creator or possessor is on hand to command it, a golem performs flawlessly.

The amulet's wearer can command the guardian to attack its enemies or to guard the wielder against attack. If an attack threatens to injure the wearer, the construct can magically absorb the blow into its own body, even at a distance.</p><p>A spellcaster can store a single spell within a shield guardian, which can then cast the spell on command or under specific conditions. Many a wizard has been rendered helpless by enemies, only to surprise those foes when its shield guardian unleashes potent magical power.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"395\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Magnificent Treasure.</span></span> <p>Because a shield guardian's ownership can be transferred by giving its matching amulet to another creature, some wizards collect exorbitant sums from princes, nobles, and crime lords to create shield guardians for them.

She can take the form of either a polar bear or a hulking, bipedal shape obscured by wind and blowing snow. Elders invoke her name to keep young goliaths from wandering too far from home before they're ready. Adult goliaths sometimes encounter this legendary individual in their travels to the far-flung corners of the dale. If they flee like cowards, Oyaminartok laughs and lets them go to wander in obscurity. If they challenge Oyaminartok to a fight, the Winter Walker smiles and tests their mettle. Those who impress her with their fighting skills are bitten and become goliath werebears themselves—goliaths who carry Oyaminartok's curse of lycanthropy. Contrary to myth, Oyaminartok is not a monster but a force of good in the region, and she passes her curse only to goliaths whose hearts are pure.</p><p>Oyaminartok and others of her kind try to help creatures they come across, for the weather and the geography of Icewind Dale can be brutal. They know the safest routes across the tundra, and they can help guide travelers through the Sea of Moving Ice and across its ever-shifting ice floes. These polar werebears attack evil in the wilderness, but they steer clear of camps and settlements. Fire is Oyaminartok's bane, and thus she and her kind are wary around hearths and open flames.</p></div>","public":""},"alignment":"neutral good","race":"","type":{"value":"humanoid","subtype":"goliath, shapechanger","swarm":null,"custom":""},"environment":"","cr":8,"spellLevel":0,"xp":{"value":3900},"source":"IDRotF","class":{}},"traits":{"size":"med","di":{"value":["physical"],"custom":""},"dr":{"value":["cold"],"custom":""},"dv":{"value":["fire"],"custom":""},"ci":{"value":[],"custom":""},"languages":{"value":["common","giant"],"custom":"Giant (can't speak in bear form)"}},"currency":{"pp":0,"gp":0,"ep":0,"sp":0,"cp":0},"skills":{"acr":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"ani":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"arc":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"ath":{"value":1,"ability":"str","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"dec":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"his":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"ins":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"itm":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"inv":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"med":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"nat":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"prc":{"value":2,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"prf":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"per":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"rel":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"slt":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"ste":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"sur":{"value":1,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}}},"spells":{"spell1":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell2":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell3":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell4":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell5":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell6":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell7":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell8":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell9":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"pact":{"value":0,"override":null},"spell0":{"value":0,"max":0}},"bonuses":{"mwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"msak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rsak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"abilities":{"check":"","save":"","skill":""},"spell":{"dc":""}},"resources":{"legact":{"value":0,"max":0},"legres":{"value":0,"max":0},"lair":{"value":false,"initiative":20}}},"ownership":{"default":0,"PP5XOkXk6hNdYKV4":3},"prototypeToken":{"name":"Goliath Werebear","displayName":20,"actorLink":false,"width":1,"height":1,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"alpha":1,"light":{"alpha":0.5,"angle":360,"bright":0,"coloration":1,"dim":0,"luminosity":0.5,"saturation":0,"contrast":0,"shadows":0,"animation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5,"reverse":false,"type":null},"darkness":{"min":0,"max":1},"attenuation":0.5,"color":null},"disposition":-1,"displayBars":40,"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.hp"},"bar2":{"attribute":null},"flags":{},"randomImg":false,"texture":{"src":"assets/srd5e/img/IDRotF/Goliath Werebear.png","scaleX":1,"scaleY":1,"offsetX":0,"offsetY":0,"rotation":0,"tint":null},"sight":{"angle":360,"enabled":true,"range":0,"brightness":1,"visionMode":"basic","color":null,"attenuation":0.1,"saturation":0,"contrast":0},"detectionModes":[]},"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.0.1","coreVersion":"10.284","createdTime":null,"modifiedTime":1662383860888,"lastModifiedBy":"PP5XOkXk6hNdYKV4"}}

They are vicious, cruel reptiles driven by hunger and greed.</p><p>A white dragon has feral eyes, a sleek profile, and a spined crest. The scales of a wyrmling white dragon glisten pure white. As the dragon ages, its sheen disappears and some of its scales begin to darken, so that by the time it is old, it is mottled by patches of pale blue and light gray. This patterning helps the dragon blend into the realms of ice and stone in which it hunts, and to fade from view when it soars across a cloud-filled sky.</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"372\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Primal and Vengeful.</span></span> <p>White dragons lack the cunning and tactics of most other dragons. However, their bestial nature makes them the best hunters among all dragonkind, singularly focused on surviving and slaughtering their enemies. A white dragon consumes only food that has been frozen, devouring creatures killed by its breath weapon while they are still stiff and frigid. It encases other kills in ice or buries them in snow near its lair, and finding such a larder is a good indication that a white dragon dwells nearby.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div><p>A white dragon also keeps the bodies of its greatest enemies as trophies, freezing corpses where it can look upon them and gloat. The remains of giants, remorhazes, and other dragons are often positioned prominently within a white dragon's lair as warnings to intruders.</p><p>Though only moderately intelligent, white dragons have extraordinary memories. They recall every slight and defeat, and have been known to conduct malicious vendettas against creatures that have offended them. This often includes silver dragons, which lair in the same territories as whites. White dragons can speak as all dragons can, but they rarely talk unless moved to do so.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"373\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Lone Masters.</span></span> <p>White dragons avoid all other dragons except whites of the opposite sex. Even then, when white dragons seek each other out as mates, they stay together only long enough to conceive offspring before fleeing into isolation again.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div><p>White dragons can't abide rivals near their lairs. As a result, a white dragon attacks other creatures without provocation, viewing such creatures as either too weak or too powerful to live. The only creatures that typically serve a white dragon are intelligent humanoids that demonstrate enough strength to assuage the dragon's wrath, and can put up with sustaining regular losses as a result of its hunger. This includes dragon-worshiping kobolds, which are commonly found in their lairs.</p><p>Powerful creatures can sometimes gain a white dragon's obedience through a demonstration of physical or magical might. Frost giants challenge white dragons to prove their own strength and improve their status in their clans, and their cracked bones litter many a white dragon's lair. However, a white dragon defeated by a frost giant often becomes its servant, accepting the mastery of a superior creature in exchange for asserting its own domination over the other creatures that serve or oppose the giant.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"374\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Treasure Under Ice.</span></span> <p>White dragons love the cold sparkle of ice and favor treasure with similar qualities, particularly diamonds. However, in their remote arctic climes, the treasure hoards of white dragons more often contain walrus and mammoth tusk ivory, whale-bone sculptures, figureheads from ships, furs, and magic items seized from overly bold adventurers.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div><p>Loose coins and gems are spread across a white dragon's lair, glittering like stars when the light strikes them. Larger treasures and chests are encased in layers of rime created by the white dragon's breath, and held safe beneath layers of transparent ice. The dragon's great strength allows it to easily access its wealth, while lesser creatures must spend hours chipping away or melting the ice to reach the dragon's main hoard.</p><p>A white dragon's flawless memory means that it knows how it came to possess every coin, gem, and magic item in its hoard, and it associates each item with a specific victory. White dragons are notoriously difficult to bribe, since any offers of treasure are seen as an insult to their ability to simply slay the creature making the offer and seize the treasure on their own.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"375\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">A White Dragon's Lair.</span></span> <p>White dragons lair in icy caves and deep subterranean chambers far from the sun. They favor high mountain vales accessible only by flying, caverns in cliff faces, and labyrinthine ice caves in glaciers. White dragons love vertical heights in their caverns, flying up to the ceiling to latch on like bats or slithering down icy crevasses.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div><p>A legendary white dragon's innate magic deepens the cold in the area around its lair. Mountain caverns are fast frozen by the white dragon's presence. A white dragon can often detect intruders by the way the keening wind in its lair changes tone.</p><p>A white dragon rests on high ice shelves and cliffs in its lair, the floor around it a treacherous morass of broken ice and stone, hidden pits, and slippery slopes. As foes struggle to move toward it, the dragon flies from perch to perch and destroys them with its freezing breath.</p></div></div></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"376\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Chromatic Dragons</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></span> <p>The black, blue, green, red, and white dragons represent the evil side of dragonkind.

They believe that the world's wealth belongs to them by right, and a chromatic dragon seizes that wealth without regard for the humanoids and other creatures that have \"stolen\" it. With its piles of coins, gleaming gems, and magic items, a dragon's hoard is the stuff of legend. However, chromatic dragons have no interest in commerce, amassing wealth for no other reason than to have it.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"378\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Creatures of Ego</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></span> <p>Chromatic dragons are united by their sense of superiority, believing themselves the most powerful and worthy of all mortal creatures. When they interact with other creatures, it is only to further their own interests. They believe in their innate right to rule, and this belief is the cornerstone of every chromatic dragon's personality and worldview. Trying to humble a chromatic dragon is like trying to convince the wind to stop blowing. To these creatures, humanoids are animals, fit to serve as prey or beasts of burden, and wholly unworthy of respect.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"379\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Dangerous Lairs</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></span> <p>A dragon's lair serves as the seat of its power and a vault for its treasure. With its innate toughness and tolerance for severe environmental effects, a dragon selects or builds a lair not for shelter but for defense, favoring multiple entrances and exits, and security for its hoard.</p><p>Most chromatic dragon lairs are hidden in dangerous and remote locations to prevent all but the most audacious mortals from reaching them. A black dragon might lair in the heart of a vast swamp, while a red dragon might claim the caldera of an active volcano. In addition to the natural defenses of their lairs, powerful chromatic dragons use magical guardians, traps, and subservient creatures to protect their treasures.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"380\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Queen of Evil Dragons</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></span> <p>Tiamat the Dragon Queen is the chief deity of evil dragonkind. She dwells on Avernus, the first layer of the Nine Hells. As a lesser god, Tiamat has the power to grant spells to her worshipers, though she is loath to share her power. She epitomizes the avarice of evil dragons, believing that the multiverse and all its treasures will one day be hers and hers alone.</p><p>Tiamat is a gigantic dragon whose five heads reflect the forms of the chromatic dragons that worship her-black, blue, green, red, and white. She is a terror on the battlefield, capable of annihilating whole armies with her five breath weapons, her formidable spellcasting, and her fearsome claws.</p><p>Tiamat's most hated enemy is Bahamut the Platinum Dragon, with whom she shares control of the faith of dragonkind. She also holds a special enmity for Asmodeus, who long ago stripped her of the rule of Avernus and who continues to curb the Dragon Queen's power.</p></div></div><p>True dragons are winged reptiles of ancient lineage and fearsome power. They are known and feared for their predatory cunning and greed, with the oldest dragons accounted as some of the most powerful creatures in the world. Dragons are also magical creatures whose innate power fuels their dreaded breath weapons and other preternatural abilities.</p><p>Many creatures, including wyverns and dragon turtles, have draconic blood. However, true dragons fall into the two broad categories of chromatic and metallic dragons. The black, blue, green, red, and white dragons are selfish, evil, and feared by all. The brass, bronze, copper, gold, and silver dragons are noble, good, and highly respected by the wise.</p><p>Though their goals and ideals vary tremendously, all true dragons covet wealth, hoarding mounds of coins and gathering gems, jewels, and magic items. Dragons with large hoards are loath to leave them for long, venturing out of their lairs only to patrol or feed.</p><p>True dragons pass through four distinct stages of life, from lowly wyrmlings to ancient dragons, which can live for over a thousand years.

The Reghed wear heavy furs as well as gloves, boots, and masks made of animal hide, to protect themselves from the bitter cold.</p><p>Although they originally descended from humans who were predominantly blue-eyed and fair-haired, the Reghed tribes have assimilated other folk, adding new blood to their dwindling ranks. There used to be more than four Reghed tribes, but the others have all disbanded over the past century, with many of their former members settling in Ten-Towns and abandoning their traditional ways.</p><p>The Reghed tribes rely on a nomadic lifestyle to survive, as they follow herds of reindeer along the route of the animals' annual migration. When they make camp, the tribesfolk live in large, round tents made of deerskin and supported by wooden shafts.</p><p>Reghed tribe camps are scattered throughout Icewind Dale. None of them appear on maps because they don't stay in one place for long.</p><p>Each Reghed tribe is made up of smaller clans, each with its own chieftain (the most powerful of whom often carries the title of king or queen). A clan might set up its camp for a tenday or two, then dismantle it and go back on the move, allowing the clan to stay close to a migrating herd of reindeer as it travels across the tundra.</p><p>This great warrior is often the chieftain's spouse, sibling, offspring, or childhood friend—someone the chieftain trusts.</p></div></div></div>","public":""},"alignment":"any alignment","race":"","type":{"value":"humanoid","subtype":"any race","swarm":null,"custom":""},"environment":"","cr":5,"spellLevel":0,"xp":{"value":1800},"source":"IDRotF","class":{}},"traits":{"size":"med","di":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dr":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dv":{"value":[],"custom":""},"ci":{"value":[],"custom":""},"languages":{"value":["common"],"custom":""}},"currency":{"pp":0,"gp":0,"ep":0,"sp":0,"cp":0},"skills":{"acr":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"ani":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"arc":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"ath":{"value":2,"ability":"str","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"dec":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"his":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"ins":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"itm":{"value":1,"ability":"cha","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"inv":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"med":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"nat":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"prc":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"prf":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"per":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"rel":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"slt":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"ste":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"sur":{"value":1,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}}},"spells":{"spell1":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell2":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell3":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell4":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell5":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell6":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell7":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell8":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell9":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"pact":{"value":0,"override":null},"spell0":{"value":0,"max":0}},"bonuses":{"mwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"msak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rsak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"abilities":{"check":"","save":"","skill":""},"spell":{"dc":""}},"resources":{"legact":{"value":0,"max":0},"legres":{"value":0,"max":0},"lair":{"value":false,"initiative":20}}},"ownership":{"default":0,"PP5XOkXk6hNdYKV4":3},"prototypeToken":{"name":"Reghed Great Warrior","displayName":20,"actorLink":false,"width":1,"height":1,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"alpha":1,"light":{"alpha":0.5,"angle":360,"bright":0,"coloration":1,"dim":0,"luminosity":0.5,"saturation":0,"contrast":0,"shadows":0,"animation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5,"reverse":false,"type":null},"darkness":{"min":0,"max":1},"attenuation":0.5,"color":null},"disposition":-1,"displayBars":40,"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.hp"},"bar2":{"attribute":null},"flags":{},"randomImg":false,"texture":{"src":"assets/srd5e/img/IDRotF/Reghed Great Warrior.png","scaleX":1,"scaleY":1,"offsetX":0,"offsetY":0,"rotation":0,"tint":null},"sight":{"angle":360,"enabled":true,"range":0,"brightness":1,"visionMode":"basic","color":null,"attenuation":0.1,"saturation":0,"contrast":0},"detectionModes":[]},"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.0.1","coreVersion":"10.284","createdTime":null,"modifiedTime":1662383861004,"lastModifiedBy":"PP5XOkXk6hNdYKV4"}}

Oozes are drawn to movement and warmth. Organic material nourishes them, and when prey is scarce they feed on grime, fungus, and offal.

She appeared as the bird whose song had entranced the outcast god, then taught that song of beauty and seduction to the elf.</p><p>When her singing failed to draw Fenmarel Mestarine to her side, the elf cursed the gods, invoking a dreadful power and transforming her into the first harpy.

class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><p>An owlbear's screech echoes through dark valleys and benighted forests, piercing the quiet night to announce the death of its prey. Feathers cover the thick, shaggy coat of its bearlike body, and the limpid pupils of its great round eyes stare furiously from its owlish head.</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"733\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Deadly Ferocity.</span></span> <p>The owlbear's reputation for ferocity, aggression, stubbornness, and sheer ill temper makes it one of the most feared predators of the wild. There is little, if anything, that a hungry owlbear fears. Even monsters that outmatch an owlbear in size and strength avoid tangling with it, for this creature cares nothing about a foe's superior strength as it attacks without provocation.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"734\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Consummate Predators.</span></span> <p>An owlbear emerges from its den around sunset and hunts into the darkest hours of the night, hooting or screeching to declare its territory, to search for a mate, or to flush prey into its hunting grounds. These are typically forests familiar to the owlbear, and dense enough to limit its quarry's escape routes.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div><p>An owlbear makes its den in a cave or ruin littered with the bones of its prey. It drags partially devoured kills back to its den, storing portions of the carcass among the surrounding rocks, bushes, and trees. The scent of blood and rotting flesh hangs heavy near an owlbear's lair, attracting scavengers and thus luring more prey.</p><p>Owlbears hunt alone or in mated pairs. If quarry is plentiful, a family of owlbears might remain together for longer than is required to rear offspring. Otherwise, they part ways as soon as the young are ready to hunt.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"735\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Savage Companions.</span></span> <p>Although they are more intelligent than most animals, owlbears are difficult to tame. However, with enough time, food, and luck, an intelligent creature can train an owlbear to recognize it as a master, making it an unflinching guard or a fast and hardy mount. People of remote frontier settlements have even succeeded at racing owlbears, but spectators bet as often on which owlbear will attack its handler as they do on which will reach the finish line first.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div><p>Elven communities encourage owlbears to den beneath their treetop villages, using the beasts as a natural defense during the night. Hobgoblins favor owlbears as war beasts, and hill giants and frost giants sometimes keep owlbears as pets. A starved owlbear might show up in a gladiatorial arena, ruthlessly eviscerating and devouring its foes before a bloodthirsty audience.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"736\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Owlbear Origins.</span></span> <p>Scholars have long debated the origins of the owlbear. The most common theory is that a demented wizard created the first specimen by crossing a giant owl with a bear. However, venerable elves claim to have known these creatures for thousands of years, and some fey insist that owlbears have always existed in the Feywild.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div></div></div></div>","public":""},"alignment":"unaligned","race":"","type":{"value":"monstrosity","subtype":"","swarm":null,"custom":""},"environment":"Forest","cr":3,"spellLevel":0,"xp":{"value":700},"source":"MM","class":{}},"traits":{"size":"lg","di":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dr":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dv":{"value":[],"custom":""},"ci":{"value":[],"custom":""},"languages":{"value":[],"custom":""}},"currency":{"pp":0,"gp":0,"ep":0,"sp":0,"cp":0},"skills":{"acr":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"ani":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"arc":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"ath":{"value":0,"ability":"str","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"dec":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"his":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"ins":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"itm":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"inv":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"med":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"nat":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"prc":{"value":1,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"prf":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"per":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"rel":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"slt":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"ste":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"sur":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}}},"spells":{"spell1":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell2":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell3":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell4":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell5":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell6":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell7":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell8":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell9":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"pact":{"value":0,"override":null},"spell0":{"value":0,"max":0}},"bonuses":{"mwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"msak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rsak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"abilities":{"check":"","save":"","skill":""},"spell":{"dc":""}},"resources":{"legact":{"value":0,"max":0},"legres":{"value":0,"max":0},"lair":{"value":false,"initiative":20}}},"ownership":{"default":0,"PP5XOkXk6hNdYKV4":3},"prototypeToken":{"name":"Owlbear","displayName":20,"actorLink":false,"width":2,"height":2,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"alpha":1,"light":{"alpha":0.5,"angle":360,"bright":0,"coloration":1,"dim":0,"luminosity":0.5,"saturation":0,"contrast":0,"shadows":0,"animation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5,"reverse":false,"type":null},"darkness":{"min":0,"max":1},"attenuation":0.5,"color":null},"disposition":-1,"displayBars":40,"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.hp"},"bar2":{"attribute":null},"flags":{},"randomImg":false,"texture":{"src":"assets/srd5e/img/MM/Owlbear.png","scaleX":1,"scaleY":1,"offsetX":0,"offsetY":0,"rotation":0,"tint":null},"sight":{"angle":360,"enabled":true,"range":60,"brightness":0,"visionMode":"basic","color":null,"attenuation":0.1,"saturation":0,"contrast":0},"detectionModes":[]},"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.0.1","coreVersion":"10.284","createdTime":null,"modifiedTime":1662383861103,"lastModifiedBy":"PP5XOkXk6hNdYKV4"}}

Protruding from her feathery owl's head is a pair of curved goat horns. A cloak and cowl made of pristine white snow conceals much of her tripartite form, which her worshipers refer to as the Cold Crone. This cloak can transform into a pair of owl's wings when Auril sees fit.</p></div></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--0\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--0\" data-title-index=\"114\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Auril the Frostmaiden</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></span> <p>Auril the Frostmaiden is a neutral evil lesser god of cold indifference who embodies winter's cruelty. (For information on what defines a lesser god, see the \"<a href=\"https://5etools-mirror-1.github.io/book.html#DMG,1,divine%20rank,0\">Divine Rank</a>\" sidebar in the <a href=\"https://5etools-mirror-1.github.io/book.html#DMG\">Dungeon Master's Guide</a>.) Auril's beloved ice grasps all things in her clutches, preserving them against the ravages of time. She hoards beauty in all forms, from art objects and flowers to skilled artisans and their wondrous works, freezing them in magical ice for her pleasure alone.</p><p>Auril was aligned with the gods Talos, Umberlee, and Malar. Together they wrought terrible destruction, inspiring fear that compelled tribute to hold their power at bay. Umberlee, queen of the wrathful sea, grew to despise the enduring nature of the ice and snow Auril created. Umberlee seethed when Auril's frigid cold transformed her chaotic, unpredictable tides into rigid, motionless sheets of ice. Umberlee brought Talos and Malar into an alliance against Auril, who retreated to the coldest corner of Toril to escape their fury.</p><p>After a world-shaking event known as the Sundering, most of the gods withdrew from Toril, leaving mortals to govern their own fates without the gods' meddling, but the Frostmaiden could not stay away for long. Auril returned to her icy realm in the far north and, after a time, plunged it into frigid darkness using her magic.</p><p>Casting such great magic night after night while also granting spells to her devoted followers leaves Auril weak and vulnerable. In her self-inflicted weakened state, Auril is inclined to be cautious and avoid contact with other creatures that can harm her.</p><p>Auril's worshipers know better than to disturb her self-imposed isolation. Terrible blizzards have cut off Icewind Dale from the rest of the world, and a shroud of mist conceals her island in the Sea of Moving Ice.</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"115\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Roleplaying Auril</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></span> <p>Portraying a deity, even a lesser god such as Auril the Frostmaiden, can be daunting. For roleplaying purposes, the following suggestions might prove helpful:</p><ul class=\"rd__list\"><li class=\"rd__li \">So long as she has mortal worshipers, Auril can't truly die (although the characters can rid the world of her for a time). Thus, she has no reason to capitulate to mortals' demands. As the embodiment of winter's cruelty, she is incapable of showing mercy or compassion. Play her as a supremely cold and unfeeling entity.</li><li class=\"rd__li \">Have Auril speak only when necessary. The less she talks, the less risk you have of unintentionally demystifying her in the eyes of your players. Let her actions, not her words, define her.</li><li class=\"rd__li \">Lesser gods in the D&amp;D multiverse are extremely powerful and arrogant, but also fallible and blind to their own flaws. It's appropriate for Auril to act as though she's invincible while underestimating her mortal enemies, even in her current weakened state.</li></ul></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"116\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Lair Actions</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></span> <p>Auril dwells on Solstice, a frozen island hidden among the titanic icebergs in the Sea of Moving Ice. Few creatures know of this island, let alone how to reach it. See <a href=\"https://5etools-mirror-1.github.io/adventure.html#IDRotF,15\">chapter 5</a> for information about the regional effects that encompass the island.</p><p>While she's on the island, the Frostmaiden can take one of the following lair actions on initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties):</p><ul class=\"rd__list\"><li class=\"rd__li \">Auril instantly knows the locations and health of all other creatures on the island. She knows how much damage each of these creatures has taken, how many levels of @condition[exhaustion] they have, and what conditions are affecting them currently.</li><li class=\"rd__li \">Auril instantly teleports to any location on the island. If the space she chooses as her destination is already occupied, Auril appears in the closest unoccupied space to it instead.</li><li class=\"rd__li \">Auril telepathically communicates with any number of creatures at once, provided they're all on the island. This effect lasts until Auril stops concentrating on it (as if concentrating on a spell) or until she leaves the island or uses a different lair action.</li></ul></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"117\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Auril's Three Forms</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></span> <p>In her current weakened state, Auril can assume three different forms. To destroy her, heroes must reduce each of her forms to 0 hit points one after another. After she's defeated in her third and final form, Auril dies. As long as she has mortal followers who worship her, however, Auril is reborn at full strength during the next winter solstice, with divine power far beyond what is reflected in the stat blocks presented here.</p><p>After finishing a long rest, Auril regains any of her forms that were destroyed, provided at least one form survives. When she transitions from one form to another, she loses all the traits and actions of the old form and gains those of the new form.</p><p>A stat block is given for each of Auril's three forms.

Resembling a tall humanoid covered in sharp barbs, spines, and hooks, a barbed devil has gleaming eyes that are ever watchful for objects and creatures it might claim for itself. These fiends welcome any chance to fight when victory promises reward.</p><p>Barbed devils are known for an alertness that makes them difficult to surprise, and they attend to their duties without boredom or distraction. They use their sharp claws as weapons or hurl balls of flame at foes that try to flee them.</p></div></div><p>Devils personify tyranny, with a totalitarian society dedicated to the domination of mortal life. The shadow of the Nine Hells of Baator extends far across the multiverse, and Asmodeus, the dark lord of Nessus, strives to subjugate the cosmos to satisfy his thirst for power. To do so, he must continually expand his infernal armies, sending his servants to the mortal realm to corrupt the souls from which new devils are spawned.</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"481\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Lords of Tyranny.</span></span> <p>Devils live to conquer, enslave, and oppress. They take perverse delight in exercising authority over the weak, and any creature that defies the authority of a devil faces swift and cruel punishment. Every interaction is an opportunity for a devil to display its power, and all devils have a keen understanding of how to use and abuse their power.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div><p>Devils understand the failings that plague intelligent mortals, and they use that knowledge to lead mortals into temptation and darkness, turning creatures into slaves to their own corruption. Devils on the Material Plane use their influence to manipulate humanoid rulers, whispering evil thoughts, fomenting paranoia, and eventually driving them to tyrannical actions.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"482\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Obedience and Ambition.</span></span> <p>In accordance with their lawful alignment, devils obey even when they envy or dislike their superiors, knowing that their obedience will be rewarded. The hierarchy of the Nine Hells depends on this unswerving loyalty, without which that fiendish plane would become as anarchic as the Abyss.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div><p>At the same time, it is in the nature of devils to scheme, creating in some a desire to rule that eclipses their contentment to be ruled. This singular ambition is strongest among the archdevils whom Asmodeus appoints to rule the nine layers of the Nine Hells. These high-ranking fiends are the only devils to ever sample true power, which they crave like the sweetest ambrosia.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"483\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Dark Dealers and Soul Mongers.</span></span> <p>Devils are confined to the Lower Planes, but they can travel beyond those planes by way of portals or powerful summoning magic. They love to strike bargains with mortals seeking to gain some benefit or prize, but a mortal making such a bargain must be wary. Devils are crafty negotiators and positively ruthless at enforcing the terms of an agreement. Moreover, a contract with even the lowliest devil is enforced by Asmodeus's will. Any mortal creature that breaks such a contract instantly forfeits its soul, which is spirited away to the Nine Hells.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div><p>To own a creature's soul is to have absolute control over that creature, and most devils accept no other currency in exchange for the fiendish power and boons they can provide. A soul is usually forfeited when a mortal dies naturally, for devils are immortal and can wait years for a contract to play out. If a contract allows a devil to claim a mortal's soul before death, it can instantly return to the Nine Hells with the soul in its possession. Only divine intervention can release a soul after a devil has claimed it.</p></div></div></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"484\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">The Infernal Hierarchy</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></span> <div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><p>The Nine Hells has a rigid hierarchy that defines every aspect of its society. Asmodeus is the supreme ruler of all devils, and the only creature in the Nine Hells with the powers of a lesser god. Worshiped as such in the Material Plane, Asmodeus inspires the evil humanoid cults that take his name. In the Nine Hells, he commands scores of pit fiend generals, which in turn command legions of subordinates.</p><p>A supreme tyrant, a brilliant deceiver, and a master of subtlety, Asmodeus protects his throne by keeping his friends close and his enemies closer. He delegates most matters of rulership to the pit fiends and lesser archdevils that make up the infernal bureaucracy of the Nine Hells, even as he knows that those powerful devils conspire to usurp the Throne of Baator from which he rules. Asmodeus appoints archdevils, and he can strip any member of the infernal hierarchy of rank and status as he likes.</p><p>If it dies outside the Nine Hells, a devil disappears in a cloud of sulfurous smoke or dissolves into a pool of ichor, instantly returning to its home layer, where it reforms at full strength. Devils that die in the Nine Hells are destroyed forever-a fate that even Asmodeus fears.</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"485\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Archdevils.</span></span> <p>The archdevils include all the current and deposed rulers of the Nine Hells (see the Layers and Lords of the Nine Hells table), as well as the dukes and duchesses that make up their courts, attend them as advisers, and hope to supplant them. Every archdevil is a unique being with an appearance that reflects its particular evil nature.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"486\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Greater Devils.</span></span> <p>The greater devils include the pit fiends, erinyes, horned devils, and ice devils that command lesser devils and attend the archdevils.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"487\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Lesser Devils.</span></span> <p>The lesser devils include numerous strains of fiends, including imps, chain devils, spined devils, bearded devils, barbed devils, and bone devils.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"488\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Lemures.</span></span> <p>The lowest form of devil, lemures are the twisted and tormented souls of evil and corrupted mortals.

Archdevils and greater devils have the power to promote lemures to lesser devils. Archdevils can promote lesser devils to greater devils, and Asmodeus alone can promote a greater devil to archdevil status. This diabolic promotion invokes a brief, painful transformation, with the devil's memories passing intact from one form to the next.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div><p>Low-level promotions are typically based on need, such as when a pit fiend transforms lemures into imps to gain invisible spies under its command. High-level promotions are almost always based on merit, such as when a bone devil that distinguishes itself in battle is transformed into a horned devil by the archdevil it serves. A devil is seldom promoted more than one step at a time in the hierarchy of infernal forms.</p><p>Demotion is the customary punishment for failure or disobedience among the devils. Archdevils or greater devils can demote a lesser devil to a lemure, which loses all memory of its prior existence. An archdevil can demote a greater devil to lesser devil status, but the demoted devil retains its memories-and might seek vengeance if the severity of the demotion is excessive.</p><p>No devil can promote or demote another devil that has not sworn fealty to it, preventing rival archdevils from demoting each other's most powerful servants. Since all devils swear fealty to Asmodeus, he can freely demote any other devil, transforming it into whatever infernal form he desires.</p><table class=\"rd__table  stripe-odd-table\"><caption>Infernal Hierarchy</caption><thead><tr><th class=\"col-4\" data-rd-isroller=\"false\">Rank</th><th class=\"col-8\" data-rd-isroller=\"false\">Devil(s)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class=\"col-4\">1.</td><td class=\"col-8\">lemure</td></tr><tr><td class=\"col-4\">2.

Avarice didn't know who or what the Black Sword was until she was approached by cultists of Levistus bearing swordlike shards of chardalyn worn as pendants around their necks. These self-styled Knights of the Black Sword offered her sanctuary in the keep of Caer-Dineval, where they are based.

Crafty creatures place torches and flaming braziers in strategic areas to dissuade an ooze from leaving a particular tunnel or room.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"688\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Spawn of Juiblex.</span></span> <p> According to the Demonomicon of Iggwilv and other sources, oozes are scattered fragments or offspring of the demon lord Juiblex.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"689\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Ooze Nature.</span></span> <p> An ooze doesn't require sleep.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div></div></div></div></div>","public":""},"alignment":"unaligned","race":"","type":{"value":"ooze","subtype":"","swarm":null,"custom":""},"environment":"Underdark","cr":2,"spellLevel":0,"xp":{"value":450},"source":"MM","class":{}},"traits":{"size":"lg","di":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dr":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dv":{"value":[],"custom":""},"ci":{"value":["blinded","charmed","deafened","exhaustion","frightened","prone"],"custom":""},"languages":{"value":[],"custom":""}},"currency":{"pp":0,"gp":0,"ep":0,"sp":0,"cp":0},"skills":{"acr":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"ani":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"arc":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"ath":{"value":0,"ability":"str","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"dec":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"his":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"ins":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"itm":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"inv":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"med":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"nat":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"prc":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"prf":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"per":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"rel":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"slt":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"ste":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"sur":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}}},"spells":{"spell1":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell2":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell3":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell4":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell5":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell6":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell7":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell8":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell9":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"pact":{"value":0,"override":null},"spell0":{"value":0,"max":0}},"bonuses":{"mwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"msak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rsak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"abilities":{"check":"","save":"","skill":""},"spell":{"dc":""}},"resources":{"legact":{"value":0,"max":0},"legres":{"value":0,"max":0},"lair":{"value":false,"initiative":20}}},"ownership":{"default":0,"PP5XOkXk6hNdYKV4":3},"prototypeToken":{"name":"Gelatinous Cube","displayName":20,"actorLink":false,"width":2,"height":2,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"alpha":1,"light":{"alpha":0.5,"angle":360,"bright":0,"coloration":1,"dim":0,"luminosity":0.5,"saturation":0,"contrast":0,"shadows":0,"animation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5,"reverse":false,"type":null},"darkness":{"min":0,"max":1},"attenuation":0.5,"color":null},"disposition":-1,"displayBars":40,"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.hp"},"bar2":{"attribute":null},"flags":{},"randomImg":false,"texture":{"src":"assets/srd5e/img/MM/Gelatinous Cube.png","scaleX":1,"scaleY":1,"offsetX":0,"offsetY":0,"rotation":0,"tint":null},"sight":{"angle":360,"enabled":true,"range":60,"brightness":1,"visionMode":"basic","color":null,"attenuation":0.1,"saturation":0,"contrast":0},"detectionModes":[]},"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.0.1","coreVersion":"10.284","createdTime":null,"modifiedTime":1662383861295,"lastModifiedBy":"PP5XOkXk6hNdYKV4"}}

Doresain served Orcus faithfully in the Abyss, creating ghouls from the demon lord's other servants until an incursion by Yeenoghu, the demonic Gnoll Lord, robbed Doresain of his abyssal domain. When Orcus would not intervene on his behalf, Doresain turned to the elf gods for salvation, and they took pity on him and helped him escape certain destruction.

When all five have finished their third turn of the dance, the elemental appears in an unoccupied space within 60 feet of them. It is friendly toward them and obeys their spoken commands. It remains for 1 hour, until it or all its summoners die, or until any of its summoners dismisses it as a bonus action. A summoner can't perform the dance again until it finishes a short rest. When the elemental returns to the Elemental Plane of Air, any aarakocra within 5 feet of it can return with it.</p><div class=\"float-clear\"></div></div></div></div>","public":""},"alignment":"neutral good","race":"","type":{"value":"humanoid","subtype":"aarakocra","swarm":null,"custom":""},"environment":"Mountain","cr":0.25,"spellLevel":0,"xp":{"value":50},"source":"MM","class":{}},"traits":{"size":"med","di":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dr":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dv":{"value":[],"custom":""},"ci":{"value":[],"custom":""},"languages":{"value":["auran","aarakocra"],"custom":""}},"currency":{"pp":0,"gp":0,"ep":0,"sp":0,"cp":0},"skills":{"acr":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"ani":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"arc":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"ath":{"value":0,"ability":"str","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"dec":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"his":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"ins":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"itm":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"inv":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"med":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"nat":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"prc":{"value":2,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"prf":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"per":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"rel":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"slt":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"ste":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"sur":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}}},"spells":{"spell1":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell2":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell3":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell4":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell5":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell6":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell7":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell8":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell9":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"pact":{"value":0,"override":null},"spell0":{"value":0,"max":0}},"bonuses":{"mwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"msak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rsak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"abilities":{"check":"","save":"","skill":""},"spell":{"dc":""}},"resources":{"legact":{"value":0,"max":0},"legres":{"value":0,"max":0},"lair":{"value":false,"initiative":20}}},"ownership":{"default":0,"PP5XOkXk6hNdYKV4":3},"prototypeToken":{"name":"Aarakocra","displayName":20,"actorLink":false,"width":1,"height":1,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"alpha":1,"light":{"alpha":0.5,"angle":360,"bright":0,"coloration":1,"dim":0,"luminosity":0.5,"saturation":0,"contrast":0,"shadows":0,"animation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5,"reverse":false,"type":null},"darkness":{"min":0,"max":1},"attenuation":0.5,"color":null},"disposition":-1,"displayBars":40,"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.hp"},"bar2":{"attribute":null},"flags":{},"randomImg":false,"texture":{"src":"assets/srd5e/img/MM/Aarakocra.png","scaleX":1,"scaleY":1,"offsetX":0,"offsetY":0,"rotation":0,"tint":null},"sight":{"angle":360,"enabled":true,"range":0,"brightness":1,"visionMode":"basic","color":null,"attenuation":0.1,"saturation":0,"contrast":0},"detectionModes":[]},"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.0.1","coreVersion":"10.284","createdTime":null,"modifiedTime":1662383861303,"lastModifiedBy":"PP5XOkXk6hNdYKV4"}}

As the stone's power grew, it became possible for creatures with ordered minds, such as modrons and githzerai, to create enclaves in Limbo. However, Primus's creation had an unforeseen side effect: the chaotic energy absorbed by the stone spawned the horrors that came to be known as slaadi.

The orcs believe that in ancient days, the gods gathered to divide the world among their followers. When Gruumsh claimed the mountains, he learned they had been taken by the dwarves. He laid claim to the forests, but those had been settled by the elves. Each place that Gruumsh wanted had already been claimed. The other gods laughed at Gruumsh, but he responded with a furious bellow. Grasping his mighty spear, he laid waste to the mountains, set the forests aflame, and carved great furrows in the fields. Such was the role of the orcs, he proclaimed, to take and destroy all that the other races would deny them. To this day, the orcs wage an endless war on humans, elves, dwarves, and other folk.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div><p>Orcs hold a particular hatred for elves. The elven god Corellon Larethian half-blinded Gruumsh with a well-placed arrow to the orc god's eye. Since then, the orcs have taken particular joy in slaughtering elves. Turning his injury into a baleful gift, Gruumsh grants divine might to any champion who willingly plucks out one of its eyes in his honor.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"340\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Tribes like Plagues.</span></span> <p>Orcs gather in tribes that exert their dominance and satisfy their bloodlust by plundering villages, devouring or driving off roaming herds, and slaying any humanoids that stand against them. After savaging a settlement, orcs pick it clean of wealth and items usable in their own lands. They set the remains of villages and camps ablaze, then retreat whence they came, their bloodlust satisfied.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"341\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Ranging Scavengers.</span></span> <p>Their lust for slaughter demands that orcs dwell always within striking distance of new targets. As such, they seldom settle permanently, instead converting ruins, cavern complexes, and defeated foes' villages into fortified camps and strongholds. Orcs build only for defense, making no innovation or improvement to their lairs beyond mounting the severed body parts of their victims on spiked stockade walls or pikes jutting up from moats and trenches.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div><p>When an existing territory is depleted of food, an orc tribe divides into roving bands that scout for choice hunting grounds. When each party returns, it brings back trophies and news of targets ripe for attack, the richest of which is chosen. The tribe then sets out en masse to carve a bloody path to its new territory.</p><p>On rare occasions, a tribe's leader chooses to hold onto a particularly defensible lair for decades.

Rejecting notions of racial purity, they proudly welcome ogres, trolls, half-orcs, and orogs into their ranks.

The orcs' drive to reproduce runs stronger than any other humanoid race, and they readily crossbreed with other races. When an orc procreates with a non-orc humanoid of similar size and stature (such as a human or a dwarf), the resulting child is either an orc or a half-orc. When an orc produces young with an ogre, the child is a half-ogre of intimidating strength and brutish features called an ogrillon.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div></div></div></div>","public":""},"alignment":"chaotic evil","race":"","type":{"value":"humanoid","subtype":"orc","swarm":null,"custom":""},"environment":"Arctic, Forest, Grassland, Hill, Mountain, Swamp, Underdark","cr":0.5,"spellLevel":0,"xp":{"value":100},"source":"MM","class":{}},"traits":{"size":"med","di":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dr":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dv":{"value":[],"custom":""},"ci":{"value":[],"custom":""},"languages":{"value":["common","orc"],"custom":""}},"currency":{"pp":0,"gp":0,"ep":0,"sp":0,"cp":0},"skills":{"acr":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"ani":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"arc":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"ath":{"value":0,"ability":"str","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"dec":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"his":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"ins":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"itm":{"value":1,"ability":"cha","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"inv":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"med":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"nat":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"prc":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"prf":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"per":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"rel":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"slt":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"ste":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"sur":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}}},"spells":{"spell1":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell2":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell3":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell4":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell5":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell6":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell7":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell8":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell9":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"pact":{"value":0,"override":null},"spell0":{"value":0,"max":0}},"bonuses":{"mwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"msak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rsak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"abilities":{"check":"","save":"","skill":""},"spell":{"dc":""}},"resources":{"legact":{"value":0,"max":0},"legres":{"value":0,"max":0},"lair":{"value":false,"initiative":20}}},"ownership":{"default":0,"PP5XOkXk6hNdYKV4":3},"prototypeToken":{"name":"Orc","displayName":20,"actorLink":false,"width":1,"height":1,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"alpha":1,"light":{"alpha":0.5,"angle":360,"bright":0,"coloration":1,"dim":0,"luminosity":0.5,"saturation":0,"contrast":0,"shadows":0,"animation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5,"reverse":false,"type":null},"darkness":{"min":0,"max":1},"attenuation":0.5,"color":null},"disposition":-1,"displayBars":40,"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.hp"},"bar2":{"attribute":null},"flags":{},"randomImg":false,"texture":{"src":"assets/srd5e/img/MM/Orc.png","scaleX":1,"scaleY":1,"offsetX":0,"offsetY":0,"rotation":0,"tint":null},"sight":{"angle":360,"enabled":true,"range":60,"brightness":0,"visionMode":"basic","color":null,"attenuation":0.1,"saturation":0,"contrast":0},"detectionModes":[]},"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.0.1","coreVersion":"10.284","createdTime":null,"modifiedTime":1662383861328,"lastModifiedBy":"PP5XOkXk6hNdYKV4"}}

To keep their leader alive, the other gnolls allowed Tekeli-li to eat them one by one, yet his hunger would not abate.

These foul creatures thus hunker down in territories where death is plentiful and other carrion eaters have limited mobility. Caves, sewers, dungeons, and forested marshes are their favored lairs, but carrion crawlers are also drawn to battlefields and cemeteries. A carrion crawler roams on the hunt, its tentacles probing the air for the scent of blood or decay. In tunnels or ruins, carrion crawlers scurry across the ceiling as they move toward food.

When facing potential prey or intruders, a carrion crawler lets its poison do the work. Once a victim goes rigid with paralysis, the carrion crawler wraps it with its tentacles and drags it away to a high ledge or isolated passageway, where it can be killed safely.

A spiny frill rises high over its head, tracing down its neck to the tip of its tail. A silver wyrmling's scales are blue-gray with silver highlights. As the dragon approaches adulthood, its color gradually brightens until its individual scales are barely visible. As a silver dragon grows older, its pupils fade until its eyes resemble orbs of mercury.</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"507\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Dragons of Virtue.</span></span> <p>Silver dragons believe that living a moral life involves doing good deeds and ensuring that one's actions cause no undeserved harm to other sentient beings. They don't take it upon themselves to root out evil, as gold and bronze dragons do, but they will gladly oppose creatures that dare to commit evil acts or harm the innocent.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"508\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Friends of the Small Races.</span></span> <p>Silver dragons enjoy the company of other silver dragons. Their only true friendships outside their own kin arise in the company of humanoids, and many silver dragons spend as much time in humanoid form as they do in draconic form. A silver dragon adopts a benign humanoid persona such as a kindly old sage or a young wanderer, and it often has mortal companions with whom it develops strong friendships.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div><p>Silver dragons must step away from their humanoid lives on a regular basis, returning to their true forms to mate and rear offspring, or to tend to their hoards and personal affairs. Because many lose track of time while away, they sometimes return to find that their companions have grown old or died. Silver dragons often end up befriending several generations of humanoids within a single family as a result.</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"509\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Respect for Humanity.</span></span> <p> Silver dragons befriend humanoids of all races, but shorter-lived races such as humans spark their curiosity in a way the longer-lived elves and dwarves don't. Humans have a drive and zest for life that silver dragons find fascinating.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div></div></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"510\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Hoarding History.</span></span> <p>Silver dragons love to possess relics of humanoid history. This includes the great piles of coins they covet, minted by current and fallen humanoid empires, as well as art objects and fine jewelery crafted by numerous races. Other treasures that make up their hoards can include intact ships, the remains of kings and queens, thrones, the crown jewels of ancient empires, inventions and contraptions, and monoliths carried from the ruins of fallen cities.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"511\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">A Silver Dragon's Lair.</span></span> <p>Silver dragons dwell among the clouds, making their lairs on secluded cold mountain peaks. Though many are comfortable in natural cavern complexes or abandoned mines, silver dragons covet the lost outposts of humanoid civilization. An abandoned mountaintop citadel or a remote tower raised by a long-dead wizard is the sort of lair that every silver dragon dreams of.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div></div></div></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"512\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Metallic Dragons</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></span> <p>Metallic dragons seek to preserve and protect, viewing themselves as one powerful race among the many races that have a place in the world.</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"513\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Noble Curiosity</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></span> <p>Metallic dragons covet treasure as do their evil chromatic kin, but they aren't driven as much by greed in their pursuit of wealth. Rather, metallic dragons are driven to investigate and collect, taking unclaimed relics and storing them in their lairs. A metallic dragon's treasure hoard is filled with items that reflect its persona, tell its history, and preserve its memories. Metallic dragons also seek to protect other creatures from dangerous magic. As such, powerful magic items and even evil artifacts are sometimes secreted away in a metallic dragon's hoard.</p><p>A metallic dragon can be persuaded to part with an item in its hoard for the greater good. However, another creature's need for or right to the item is often unclear from the dragon's point of view. A metallic dragon must be bribed or otherwise convinced to part with the item.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"514\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Solitary Shapeshifters</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></span> <p>At some point in their long lives, metallic dragons gain the magical ability to assume the forms of humanoids and beasts. When a dragon learns how to disguise itself, it might immerse itself in other cultures for a time. Some dragons are too shy or paranoid to stray far from their lairs and their treasure hoards, but bolder dragons love to wander city streets in humanoid form, taking in the local culture and cuisine, and amusing themselves by observing how the smaller races live.</p><p>Some metallic dragons prefer to stay as far away from civilization as possible so as to not attract enemies. However, this means that they are often far out of touch with current events.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"515\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">The Persistence of Memory</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></span> <p>Metallic dragons have long memories, and they form opinions of humanoids based on previous contact with related humanoids. Good dragons can recognize humanoid bloodlines by smell, sniffing out each person they meet and remembering any relatives they have come into contact with over the years. A gold dragon might never suspect duplicity from a cunning villain, assuming that the villain is of the same mind and heart as a good and virtuous grandmother. On the other hand, the dragon might resent a noble paladin whose ancestor stole a silver statue from the dragon's hoard three centuries before.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"516\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">King of Good Dragons</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></span> <p>The chief deity of the metallic dragons is Bahamut, the Platinum Dragon. He dwells in the Seven Heavens of Mount Celestia, but often wanders the Material Plane in the magical guise of a venerable human male in peasant robes. In this form, he is usually accompanied by seven golden canaries-actually seven ancient gold dragons in polymorphed form.</p><p>Bahamut seldom interferes in the affairs of mortal creatures, though he makes exceptions to help thwart the machinations of Tiamat the Dragon Queen and her evil brood. Good-aligned clerics and paladins sometimes worship Bahamut for his dedication to justice and protection. As a lesser god, he has the power to grant divine spells.</p></div></div><p>True dragons are winged reptiles of ancient lineage and fearsome power. They are known and feared for their predatory cunning and greed, with the oldest dragons accounted as some of the most powerful creatures in the world. Dragons are also magical creatures whose innate power fuels their dreaded breath weapons and other preternatural abilities.</p><p>Many creatures, including wyverns and dragon turtles, have draconic blood. However, true dragons fall into the two broad categories of chromatic and metallic dragons. The black, blue, green, red, and white dragons are selfish, evil, and feared by all. The brass, bronze, copper, gold, and silver dragons are noble, good, and highly respected by the wise.</p><p>Though their goals and ideals vary tremendously, all true dragons covet wealth, hoarding mounds of coins and gathering gems, jewels, and magic items. Dragons with large hoards are loath to leave them for long, venturing out of their lairs only to patrol or feed.</p><p>True dragons pass through four distinct stages of life, from lowly wyrmlings to ancient dragons, which can live for over a thousand years.

Insults and name-calling can rouse an ogre's wrath in an instant-as can stealing from it, bumping, jabbing, or prodding it, laughing, making faces, or simply looking at it the wrong way. When its rage is incited, an ogre lashes out in a frustrated tantrum until it runs out of objects or creatures to smash.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"261\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Gruesome Gluttons.</span></span> <p>Ogres eat almost anything, but they especially enjoy the taste of dwarves, halflings, and elves. When they can, they combine dinner with pleasure, chasing scurrying victims around before eating them raw. If enough of its victim remains after the ogre has gorged itself, it might make a loincloth from its quarry's skin and a necklace from its leftover bones.

Ogres carry rough sacks on their raids, which they fill with fabulous \"treasure\" taken from their victims. This might include a collection of battered helmets, a moldy wheel of cheese, a rough patch of animal fur fastened like a cloak, or a squealing, mud-spattered pig. Ogres also delight in the gleam of gold and silver, and they will fight one another over small handfuls of coins. Smarter creatures can earn an ogre's trust by offering it gold or a weapon forged for a creature of its size.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"263\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Legendary Stupidity.</span></span> <p>Few ogres can count to ten, even with their fingers in front of them. Most speak only a rudimentary form of Giant and know a smattering of Common words. Ogres believe what they are told and are easy to fool or confuse, but they break things they don't understand. Silver-tongued tricksters who test their talents on these savages typically end up eating their eloquent words-and then being eaten in turn.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"264\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Primitive Wanderers.</span></span> <p>Ogres clothe themselves in animal pelts and uproot trees for use as crude tools and weapons.

However, ogre bands are just as likely to trade members freely, especially if the welcoming band is temporarily flush with food and weapons.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div><p>Whenever possible, ogres gang up with other monsters to bully or prey on creatures weaker than themselves. They associate freely with goblinoids, orcs, and trolls, and practically worship giants.

strength. Its brain is capable of simple reason, though its thoughts are no more sophisticated than those of a young child. The golem's muscle tissue responds to the power of lightning, invigorating the creature with vitality and strength. Powerful enchantments protect the golem's skin, deflecting spells and all but the most potent weapons.</p><p>A flesh golem lurches with a stiff-jointed gait, as if not in complete control of its body. Its dead flesh isn't an ideal container for an elemental spirit, which sometimes howls incoherently to vent its outrage. If the spirit breaks free of its creator's will, the golem goes berserk until calmed, or until its shell of flesh is destroyed or completely healed.</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"383\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Golems.</span></span> <p>Golems are made from humble materials-clay, flesh and bones, iron, or stone-but they possess astonishing power and durability. A golem has no ambitions, needs no sustenance, feels no pain, and knows no remorse. An unstoppable juggernaut, it exists to follow its creator's orders, and it protects or attacks as that creator demands.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div><p>To create a golem, one requires a manual of golems (see the Dungeon Master's Guide).

Sometimes a golem's creator is the master of the art, but often the individual who desires a golem must enlist master artisans to do the work.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div><p>After constructing the body from clay, flesh, iron, or stone, the golem's creator infuses it with a spirit from the Elemental Plane of Earth. This tiny spark of life has no memory, personality, or history. It is simply the impetus to move and obey. This process binds the spirit to the artificial body and subjects it to the will of the golem's creator.</p><p>A golem can be created with a special amulet or other item that allows the possessor of the item to control the golem. Golems whose creators are long dead can thus be harnessed to serve a new master.</p><p>A golem can't think or act for itself. Though it understands its commands perfectly, it has no grasp of language beyond that understanding, and can't be reasoned with or tricked with words.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"385\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Ageless Guardians.</span></span> <p> Golems can guard sacred sites, tombs, and treasure vaults long after the deaths of their creators, carrying out their appointed tasks for all eternity while brushing off physical damage and ignoring all but the most potent spells.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"386\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Blind Obedience.</span></span> <p> When its creator or possessor is on hand to command it, a golem performs flawlessly.

A griffon ignores a horse's rider when possible, and a rider that abandons its mount, or a herder that releases one or two horses, can escape unharmed while the griffon targets its chosen prey.

raids and pillaging. They respect only brute strength and skill in battle, demonstrating both with their scars and the grisly trophies they take from their enemies.</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"313\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Hearts of Ice.</span></span> <p>Frost giants are creatures of ice and snow.

Their flesh is as blue as glacial ice.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div><p>Frost giants dwell in high peaks and glacial rifts where the sun hides its golden head by winter. Crops don't grow in their frozen homelands, and they keep little livestock beyond what they capture in their raids against civilized lands. They hunt the wild game of the tundra and mountains but don't cook it, since meat from a fresh kill tastes sufficiently hot to their palate.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"314\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Reavers of the Storm.</span></span> <p>The war horns of the frost giants howl as they march from their ice fortresses and glacial rifts amid the howling blizzard. When that storm clears, villages and steadings lay in ruins, ravens descending to feed on the corpses of any creatures foolish or unlucky enough to stand in the giants' path.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div><p>Inns and taverns suffer the brunt of the damage, their cellars gutted and their casks of ale and mead gone. Smithies are likewise toppled, their iron and steel claimed. Curiously undisturbed are the houses of moneylenders and wealthy citizens, for the reavers have little use for coins or baubles. Frost giants prize gems and jewelry large enough to be worn and noticed. However, even those treasures are most often saved for trading opportunities with other giants more adept at crafting metal weapons and armor.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"315\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Rulers by Might.</span></span> <p>Frost giants respect brute strength above all else, and a frost giant's place in the ordning depends on evidence of physical might, such as superior musculature, scars from battles of renown, or trophies fashioned from the bodies of slain enemies. Tasks such as hunting, childrearing, and crafting are given to giants based on their physical strength and hardiness.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div><p>When frost giants of different clans meet and their status is unclear, they wrestle for dominance. Such meetings might resemble festivals where giants cheer on their champions, making bold boasts and challenges. At other times, the informal ceremony can become a chaotic free-for-all where both clans rush into a melee that fells trees, shatters the ice on frozen lakes, and causes avalanches on the snowy mountainsides.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"316\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Make War, Not Goods.</span></span> <p>Though frost giants consider the menial crafting of goods beneath them, carving and leatherwork are valued skills. They make their clothing from the skins and bones of beasts, and carve bone or ivory into jewelry and the handles of weapons and tools. They reuse the weapons and armor of their smaller foes, stringing shields into scale armor and lashing sword blades to wooden hafts to make giant-sized spears. The greatest battle trophies come from conquered dragons, and the greatest frost giant jarls wear armor of dragon scales or wield picks and mauls made of a dragon's teeth or claws.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div></div></div></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--0\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--0\" data-title-index=\"317\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Giants</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></span> <p>Ancient empires once cast long shadows over a world that quaked beneath the giants' feet. In those lost days, these towering figures were dragon slayers, dreamers, crafters, and kings, but their kind fell from glory long ago. However, even divided among secluded clans scattered throughout the world, the giants maintain the customs and traditions of old.</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"318\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Old as Legend</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></span> <p>In remote regions of the world, the last remaining plinths, monoliths, and statues of the great giant empires bow their heads in desolate obscurity. Where once those empires sprawled across all lands, now the giants dwell in isolated tribes and clans.</p><p>Giants are almost as old as dragons, which were still young when the giants' heavy feet first shook the foundations of the world. As they spread across new lands, giants and dragons fought bitter generational wars that nearly brought both sides low. No living giant remembers what started the conflict, but myths and tales of their race's glorious dawn are still sung in their steadings and holdfasts, vilifying the primeval wyrms. Giants and dragons continue to harbor grudges against one another, and it is seldom that they will meet or occupy the same area without a fight.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"319\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">The Ordning</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></span> <p>Each of the main giant races-the cloud, fire, frost, hill, stone, and storm giants-are related by common elements of history, religion, and culture. They view one another as kindred, keeping any inherent animosity over territory and ambition to a minimum.</p><p>Giants belong to a caste structure called the ordning. Based on social class and highly organized, the ordning assigns a social rank to each giant. By understanding its place in the ordning, a giant knows which other giants are inferior or superior to it, since no two giants are equal. Each of the giant races analyzes a different combination of skills or qualities to determine the ordning. Giants make excelling in these qualities the purpose of their lives.</p><p>At the highest level of the ordning, the races of the giants are also ranked according to status. Storm giants are the highest in the ordning, followed by cloud giants, fire giants, frost giants, stone giants, hill giants, and finally giant kin such as fomorians, ettins, and ogres.</p><p>Regardless of a giant's rank among its own race, the chief of a hill giant tribe is inferior to the most common of stone giants. The lowest ranked giant of any type is superior to the highest ranked giant of an inferior type. It isn't considered evil to disrespect or even betray a giant of another type, merely rude.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b-special rd__b-inset \"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2-inset\" data-title-index=\"320\"><span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Giant Gods</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-special-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></span><p>When the giants' ancient empires fell, Annam, father of all giants, forsook his children and the world. He swore never to look upon either again until the giants had returned to their glory and reclaimed their birthright as rulers of the world. As a result, giants pray not to Annam but to his divine children, along with a host of hero-deities and godly villains that make up the giants' pantheon.</p><p>Chief among these gods are the children of Annam, whose sons represent each type of giant: Stronmaus for storm giants, Memnor for cloud giants, Skoraeus Stonebones for stone giants, Thrym for frost giants, Surtur for fire giants, and Grolantor for hill giants. Not all giants automatically revere their kind's primary deity, however. Many good cloud giants refuse to worship the deceitful Memnor, and a storm giant dwelling in the icy mountains of the north might pay more homage to Thrym than Stronmaus. Other giants feel a stronger connection to Annam's daughters, who include Hiatea, the huntress and home warden; Iallanis, goddess of love and peace; and Diancastra, an impetuous and arrogant trickster.</p><p>Some giants abandon their own gods and fall prey to demon cults, paying homage to Baphomet or Kostchtchie. To worship them or any other non-giant deity is a great sin against the ordning, and almost certain to make a giant an outcast.</p><div class=\"float-clear\"></div></div></div><div class=\"rd__b-special rd__b-inset\" data-source=\"SKT\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2-inset\" data-title-index=\"311\"><span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Variant: New Giant Options</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"> <span class=\"rd__title-link rd__title-link--inset\"><span class=\"help-subtle\" title=\"Storm King’s Thunder\">SKT</span> p246</span><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-special-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></span><p>Some adult frost giants are skilled hunters who construct and hurl nets weighted down with fragments of metal or bone.

They are people of the wild, as revealed by their tribal names—the Elk, the Tiger, the Wolf, the Bear. They are the tribes of Icewind Dale, proud and strong, bound to ancient traditions that have kept them alive through countless harsh winters. The Reghed wear heavy furs as well as gloves, boots, and masks made of animal hide, to protect themselves from the bitter cold.</p><p>Although they originally descended from humans who were predominantly blue-eyed and fair-haired, the Reghed tribes have assimilated other folk, adding new blood to their dwindling ranks. There used to be more than four Reghed tribes, but the others have all disbanded over the past century, with many of their former members settling in Ten-Towns and abandoning their traditional ways.</p><p>The Reghed tribes rely on a nomadic lifestyle to survive, as they follow herds of reindeer along the route of the animals' annual migration. When they make camp, the tribesfolk live in large, round tents made of deerskin and supported by wooden shafts.</p><p>Reghed tribe camps are scattered throughout Icewind Dale. None of them appear on maps because they don't stay in one place for long.</p><p>Each Reghed tribe is made up of smaller clans, each with its own chieftain (the most powerful of whom often carries the title of king or queen). A clan might set up its camp for a tenday or two, then dismantle it and go back on the move, allowing the clan to stay close to a migrating herd of reindeer as it travels across the tundra.</p></div></div></div>","public":""},"alignment":"any alignment","race":"","type":{"value":"humanoid","subtype":"any race","swarm":null,"custom":""},"environment":"","cr":5,"spellLevel":0,"xp":{"value":1800},"source":"IDRotF","class":{}},"traits":{"size":"med","di":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dr":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dv":{"value":[],"custom":""},"ci":{"value":[],"custom":""},"languages":{"value":["common"],"custom":""}},"currency":{"pp":0,"gp":0,"ep":0,"sp":0,"cp":0},"skills":{"acr":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"ani":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"arc":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"ath":{"value":2,"ability":"str","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"dec":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"his":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"ins":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"itm":{"value":1,"ability":"cha","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"inv":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"med":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"nat":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"prc":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"prf":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"per":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"rel":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"slt":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"ste":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"sur":{"value":1,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}}},"spells":{"spell1":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell2":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell3":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell4":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell5":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell6":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell7":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell8":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell9":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"pact":{"value":0,"override":null},"spell0":{"value":0,"max":0}},"bonuses":{"mwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"msak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rsak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"abilities":{"check":"","save":"","skill":""},"spell":{"dc":""}},"resources":{"legact":{"value":0,"max":0},"legres":{"value":0,"max":0},"lair":{"value":false,"initiative":20}}},"ownership":{"default":0,"PP5XOkXk6hNdYKV4":3},"prototypeToken":{"name":"Reghed Chieftain","displayName":20,"actorLink":false,"width":1,"height":1,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"alpha":1,"light":{"alpha":0.5,"angle":360,"bright":0,"coloration":1,"dim":0,"luminosity":0.5,"saturation":0,"contrast":0,"shadows":0,"animation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5,"reverse":false,"type":null},"darkness":{"min":0,"max":1},"attenuation":0.5,"color":null},"disposition":-1,"displayBars":40,"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.hp"},"bar2":{"attribute":null},"flags":{},"randomImg":false,"texture":{"src":"assets/srd5e/img/blank.png","scaleX":1,"scaleY":1,"offsetX":0,"offsetY":0,"rotation":0,"tint":null},"sight":{"angle":360,"enabled":true,"range":0,"brightness":1,"visionMode":"basic","color":null,"attenuation":0.1,"saturation":0,"contrast":0},"detectionModes":[]},"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.0.1","coreVersion":"10.284","createdTime":null,"modifiedTime":1662383861525,"lastModifiedBy":"PP5XOkXk6hNdYKV4"}}

Its wolf form is a fearsome predator, but its hybrid form is more terrifying by far-a furred and well-muscled humanoid body topped by a ravening wolf's head. A werewolf can wield weapons in hybrid form, though it prefers to tear foes apart with its powerful claws and bite.</p><p>Most werewolves flee civilized lands not long after becoming afflicted. Those that reject the curse fear what will happen if they remain among their friends and family. Those that embrace the curse fear discovery and the consequences of their murderous acts.

In its natural humanoid form, a creature cursed by lycanthropy appears as its normal self. Over time, however, many lycanthropes acquire features suggestive of their animal form. In that animal form, a lycanthrope resembles a powerful version of a normal animal. On close inspection, its eyes show a faint spark of unnatural intelligence and might glow red in the dark.</p><p>Evil lycanthropes hide among normal folk, emerging in animal form at night to spread terror and bloodshed, especially under a full moon. Good lycanthropes are reclusive and uncomfortable around other civilized creatures, often living alone in wilderness areas far from villages and towns.</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"283\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Curse of Lycanthropy</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></span> <p>A humanoid creature can be afflicted with the curse of lycanthropy after being wounded by a lycanthrope, or if one or both of its parents are lycanthropes. A @spell[remove curse] spell can rid an afflicted lycanthrope of the curse, but a natural born lycanthrope can be freed of the curse only with a wish.</p><p>A lycanthrope can either resist its curse or embrace it. By resisting the curse, a lycanthrope retains its normal alignment and personality while in humanoid form. It lives its life as it always has, burying deep the bestial urges raging inside it. However, when the full moon rises, the curse becomes too strong to resist, transforming the individual into its beast form-or into a horrible hybrid form that combines animal and humanoid traits. When the moon wanes, the beast within can be controlled once again. Especially if the cursed creature is unaware of its condition, it might not remember the events of its transformation, though those memories often haunt a lycanthrope as bloody dreams.</p><p>Some individuals see little point in fighting the curse and accept what they are. With time and experience, they learn to master their shapechanging ability and can assume beast form or hybrid form at will. Most lycanthropes that embrace their bestial natures succumb to bloodlust, becoming evil, opportunistic creatures that prey on the weak.</p></div></div><div class=\"rd__b-special rd__b-inset \"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2-inset\" data-title-index=\"284\"><span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Player Characters as Lycanthropes</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-special-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></span><p>A character who becomes a lycanthrope retains his or her statistics except as specified by lycanthrope type.

The reign of a war chief lasts only as long as it commands the fear and respect of other tribe members, whose bloodlust must be regularly satisfied lest the chief appear weak. Scions of Slaughter. Gruumsh bestows special blessings upon war chiefs who prove themselves in battle time and again, imbuing them with slivers of his savagery. A war chief so blessed finds that his weapons cut deeper into his enemies, allowing him to inflict more carnage.</p><p>King Obould Many-Arrows</p><p>King Obould of the Many-Arrows tribe is a legend among the orc war chiefs of the Forgotten Realms, and he is the most famous orc chief in the history of the D&amp;D game.</p><p>Smarter and more intuitive than most of his kind, Obould slew his chieftain to take control of his tribe. Skilled in the arts of war and renowned for his violent temper, Obould proved himself a fierce opponent in battle time and again. Over the years, he subsumed other orc tribes into his own, until he commanded a horde of thousands.</p><p>Obould leveraged his strength and influence to carve out a kingdom for himself in the Spine of the World, a mountain range overlooking numerous dwarven, human, and elven strongholds.</p><p>After years of bloody conflict with his more civilized neighbors, Obould did the unthinkable and brokered a peace treaty with his enemies. This treaty confused many of the orcs under Obould's command. It was either a clever ploy by Obould to buy time while he strengthened his army for a final, decisive sweep across the Savage Frontier, or it was a troubling sign that Obould had forsaken the ways of Gruumsh and needed to be destroyed.</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"142\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Orcs.</span></span> <p>Orcs are savage raiders and pillagers with stooped postures, low foreheads, and piggish faces with prominent lower canines that resemble tusks.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"143\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Gruumsh One-Eye.</span></span> <p> Orcs worship Gruumsh, the mightiest of the orc deities and their creator. The orcs believe that in ancient days, the gods gathered to divide the world among their followers. When Gruumsh claimed the mountains, he learned they had been taken by the dwarves. He laid claim to the forests, but those had been settled by the elves. Each place that Gruumsh wanted had already been claimed. The other gods laughed at Gruumsh, but he responded with a furious bellow. Grasping his mighty spear, he laid waste to the mountains, set the forests aflame, and carved great furrows in the fields. Such was the role of the orcs, he proclaimed, to take and destroy all that the other races would deny them. To this day, the orcs wage an endless war on humans, elves, dwarves, and other folk.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div><p>Orcs hold a particular hatred for elves. The elven god Corellon Larethian half-blinded Gruumsh with a well-placed arrow to the orc god's eye. Since then, the orcs have taken particular joy in slaughtering elves. Turning his injury into a baleful gift, Gruumsh grants divine might to any champion who willingly plucks out one of its eyes in his honor.</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"144\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Tribes like Plagues.</span></span> <p>Orcs gather in tribes that exert their dominance and satisfy their bloodlust by plundering villages, devouring or driving off roaming herds, and slaying any humanoids that stand against them. After savaging a settlement, orcs pick it clean of wealth and items usable in their own lands. They set the remains of villages and camps ablaze, then retreat whence they came, their bloodlust satisfied.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div><p>When an existing territory is depleted of food, an orc tribe divides into roving bands that scout for choice hunting grounds. When each party returns, it brings back trophies and news of targets ripe for attack, the richest of which is chosen. The tribe then sets out en masse to carve a bloody path to its new territory.</p><p>On rare occasions, a tribe's leader chooses to hold onto a particularly defensible lair for decades. The orcs of such a tribe must range far across the countryside to sate their appetites.</p><p>Strength and power are the greatest of orcish virtues, and orcs embrace all manner of mighty creatures in their tribes. Rejecting notions of racial purity, they proudly welcome ogres, trolls, half-orcs, and orogs into their ranks. As well, orcs respect and fear the size and power of evil giants, and often serve them as guards and soldiers.</p></div></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"145\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Ranging Scavengers.</span></span> <p> Their lust for slaughter demands that orcs dwell always within striking distance of new targets. As such, they seldom settle permanently, instead converting ruins, cavern complexes, and defeated foes' villages into fortified camps and strongholds. Orcs build only for defense, making no innovation or improvement to their lairs beyond mounting the severed body parts of their victims on spiked stockade walls or pikes jutting up from moats and trenches.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"146\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Leadership and Might.</span></span> <p> Orc tribes are mostly patriarchal, flaunting such vivid or grotesque titles as Many-Arrows, Screaming Eye, and Elf Ripper. Occasionally, a powerful war chief unites scattered orc tribes into a single rampaging horde, which runs roughshod over other orc tribes and humanoid settlements from a position of overwhelming strength.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"147\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Orc Crossbreeds.</span></span> <p> Luthic, the orc goddess of fertility and wife of Gruumsh, demands that orcs procreate often and indiscriminately so that orc hordes swell generation after generation. The orcs' drive to reproduce runs stronger than any other humanoid race, and they readily crossbreed with other races. When an orc procreates with a non-orc humanoid of similar size and stature (such as a human or a dwarf), the resulting child is either an orc or a half-orc. When an orc produces young with an ogre, the child is a half-ogre of intimidating strength and brutish features called an ogrillon.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div></div></div></div></div>","public":""},"alignment":"chaotic evil","race":"","type":{"value":"humanoid","subtype":"orc","swarm":null,"custom":""},"environment":"Arctic, Forest, Grassland, Hill, Mountain, Swamp, Underdark","cr":4,"spellLevel":0,"xp":{"value":1100},"source":"MM","class":{}},"traits":{"size":"med","di":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dr":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dv":{"value":[],"custom":""},"ci":{"value":[],"custom":""},"languages":{"value":["common","orc"],"custom":""}},"currency":{"pp":0,"gp":0,"ep":0,"sp":0,"cp":0},"skills":{"acr":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"ani":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"arc":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"ath":{"value":0,"ability":"str","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"dec":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"his":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"ins":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"itm":{"value":1,"ability":"cha","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"inv":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"med":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"nat":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"prc":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"prf":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"per":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"rel":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"slt":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"ste":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"sur":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}}},"spells":{"spell1":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell2":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell3":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell4":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell5":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell6":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell7":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell8":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell9":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"pact":{"value":0,"override":null},"spell0":{"value":0,"max":0}},"bonuses":{"mwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"msak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rsak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"abilities":{"check":"","save":"","skill":""},"spell":{"dc":""}},"resources":{"legact":{"value":0,"max":0},"legres":{"value":0,"max":0},"lair":{"value":false,"initiative":20}}},"ownership":{"default":0,"PP5XOkXk6hNdYKV4":3},"prototypeToken":{"name":"Orc War Chief","displayName":20,"actorLink":false,"width":1,"height":1,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"alpha":1,"light":{"alpha":0.5,"angle":360,"bright":0,"coloration":1,"dim":0,"luminosity":0.5,"saturation":0,"contrast":0,"shadows":0,"animation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5,"reverse":false,"type":null},"darkness":{"min":0,"max":1},"attenuation":0.5,"color":null},"disposition":-1,"displayBars":40,"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.hp"},"bar2":{"attribute":null},"flags":{},"randomImg":false,"texture":{"src":"assets/srd5e/img/MM/Orc War Chief.png","scaleX":1,"scaleY":1,"offsetX":0,"offsetY":0,"rotation":0,"tint":null},"sight":{"angle":360,"enabled":true,"range":60,"brightness":0,"visionMode":"basic","color":null,"attenuation":0.1,"saturation":0,"contrast":0},"detectionModes":[]},"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.0.1","coreVersion":"10.284","createdTime":null,"modifiedTime":1662383861612,"lastModifiedBy":"PP5XOkXk6hNdYKV4"}}

The war among elvenkind ended when the good elves banished their malevolent kin to the subterranean depths. Here, in the lightless caverns and endless warrens of twisting passages, the dark elves-the drow-found refuge. They also found leadership in the only elven deity who had not forsaken them. At her command, the dark elves built an empire in the underworld.</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"537\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Children of Lolth.</span></span> <p>The drow worship Lolth, a deity who resides in the Abyss. Known as the Spider Queen or the Demon Queen of Spiders, she is the figure around which the dark elves have built their subterranean civilization. Whatever she demands, the drow do. The wickedest of elves, drow are seldom seen by the surface world. Though they plot to destroy the elves that banished them, they no longer see themselves as exiles. They are the destined rulers of the darkness, and when Lolth commands them to rise up and destroy their surface-dwelling kin, they will.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div></div><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"538\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Creatures of Darkness.</span></span> <p>The drow have lived underground for so long that they have evolved to their surroundings and can see in the dark. However, they can no longer stand sunlight. When slaves are in short supply in the Underdark, the drow send raiding parties to the surface to capture humanoids under cover of darkness, bringing them back to their cities to be tortured into submission. Beyond those occasional excursions, the drow are content to remain in their subterranean realm, where they feel secure and in control.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"539\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Underdark Cities.</span></span> <p>The dark elves build fantastic cities in enormous caverns where food and water are abundant. Their ability to sculpt stone rivals that of the greatest dwarf artisans, yet their structures retain a decidedly elven aesthetic. Though appearing delicate, drow settlements are structurally sound and remarkably resilient. The drow like to hollow out enormous stalagmites and stalactites, creating populated spires that rise from the floors and ceilings. A drow city is a sprawling metropolis enclosed by high walls. Non-drow visitors must conduct their business outside the walls under watchful eyes. The drow raise and keep giant spiders to help protect their cities against intruders, even as they drape those cities in beautiful webbing, creating a gossamer snare to catch flying enemies that would otherwise soar over the walls.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"540\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Drow Magic.</span></span> <p>Just as the drow have adapted to underground life, so too has their magic. In addition to using that magic to carve their cities from stone, they empower their weapons, create dangerous new magic items, and summon demons from the Abyss. Drow spellcasters are supremely arrogant and never hesitate to use their magic in the most abhorrent ways.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"541\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Arms and Armor.</span></span> <p>Drow craft weapons made of adamantine, a dark and supernaturally hard metal. Drow artisans adorn their weapons and armor with web-like filigree and spider motifs, and mages sometimes imbue items with magic to enhance their effectiveness. However, such magic fades when exposed to sunlight, so that magical drow weapons and armor rarely retain their enhancement bonuses and magical properties when brought to the surface.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"542\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Cutthroat Politics.</span></span> <p>Drow politics are cutthroat and rife with intrigue.

Other high-ranking members of the house are blood relatives, while the middling ranks are flush with drow from weaker families that have sworn fealty to the greater house. Clinging precariously to the bottom rung of a house's social ladder are the house slaves, made up of drow of low birth and the occasional non-drow captive.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"543\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Matriarchal Rule.</span></span> <p>Lolth, through her faithful priestesses, dictates the rules of drow society, ensuring that her orders and plots are carried out. Since Lolth is prone to manifesting on the Material Plane and directly punishing those that disobey her, the drow have learned to heed what she says and do as her priestesses command.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div><p>In drow society, males are subservient to females. A male drow might lead an Underdark patrol or a raiding party to the surface, but he reports to a female drow-either the matron of his house or one of her hand-picked female subordinates. Although male drow can fill almost any function in drow society, they can't be priests, nor can they rule a house.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"544\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Poison Predilection.</span></span> <p>Distilled from spider venom and the flora of the Underdark, poison can be found in abundance among the drow, and it plays an important part in their culture and politics.

They are vicious, cruel reptiles driven by hunger and greed.</p><p>A white dragon has feral eyes, a sleek profile, and a spined crest. The scales of a wyrmling white dragon glisten pure white. As the dragon ages, its sheen disappears and some of its scales begin to darken, so that by the time it is old, it is mottled by patches of pale blue and light gray. This patterning helps the dragon blend into the realms of ice and stone in which it hunts, and to fade from view when it soars across a cloud-filled sky.</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"297\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Primal and Vengeful.</span></span> <p>White dragons lack the cunning and tactics of most other dragons. However, their bestial nature makes them the best hunters among all dragonkind, singularly focused on surviving and slaughtering their enemies. A white dragon consumes only food that has been frozen, devouring creatures killed by its breath weapon while they are still stiff and frigid. It encases other kills in ice or buries them in snow near its lair, and finding such a larder is a good indication that a white dragon dwells nearby.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div><p>A white dragon also keeps the bodies of its greatest enemies as trophies, freezing corpses where it can look upon them and gloat. The remains of giants, remorhazes, and other dragons are often positioned prominently within a white dragon's lair as warnings to intruders.</p><p>Though only moderately intelligent, white dragons have extraordinary memories. They recall every slight and defeat, and have been known to conduct malicious vendettas against creatures that have offended them. This often includes silver dragons, which lair in the same territories as whites. White dragons can speak as all dragons can, but they rarely talk unless moved to do so.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"298\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Lone Masters.</span></span> <p>White dragons avoid all other dragons except whites of the opposite sex. Even then, when white dragons seek each other out as mates, they stay together only long enough to conceive offspring before fleeing into isolation again.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div><p>White dragons can't abide rivals near their lairs. As a result, a white dragon attacks other creatures without provocation, viewing such creatures as either too weak or too powerful to live. The only creatures that typically serve a white dragon are intelligent humanoids that demonstrate enough strength to assuage the dragon's wrath, and can put up with sustaining regular losses as a result of its hunger. This includes dragon-worshiping kobolds, which are commonly found in their lairs.</p><p>Powerful creatures can sometimes gain a white dragon's obedience through a demonstration of physical or magical might. Frost giants challenge white dragons to prove their own strength and improve their status in their clans, and their cracked bones litter many a white dragon's lair. However, a white dragon defeated by a frost giant often becomes its servant, accepting the mastery of a superior creature in exchange for asserting its own domination over the other creatures that serve or oppose the giant.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"299\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Treasure Under Ice.</span></span> <p>White dragons love the cold sparkle of ice and favor treasure with similar qualities, particularly diamonds.

Larger treasures and chests are encased in layers of rime created by the white dragon's breath, and held safe beneath layers of transparent ice. The dragon's great strength allows it to easily access its wealth, while lesser creatures must spend hours chipping away or melting the ice to reach the dragon's main hoard.</p><p>A white dragon's flawless memory means that it knows how it came to possess every coin, gem, and magic item in its hoard, and it associates each item with a specific victory. White dragons are notoriously difficult to bribe, since any offers of treasure are seen as an insult to their ability to simply slay the creature making the offer and seize the treasure on their own.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"300\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">A White Dragon's Lair.</span></span> <p>White dragons lair in icy caves and deep subterranean chambers far from the sun. They favor high mountain vales accessible only by flying, caverns in cliff faces, and labyrinthine ice caves in glaciers. White dragons love vertical heights in their caverns, flying up to the ceiling to latch on like bats or slithering down icy crevasses.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div><p>A legendary white dragon's innate magic deepens the cold in the area around its lair. Mountain caverns are fast frozen by the white dragon's presence. A white dragon can often detect intruders by the way the keening wind in its lair changes tone.</p><p>A white dragon rests on high ice shelves and cliffs in its lair, the floor around it a treacherous morass of broken ice and stone, hidden pits, and slippery slopes.

They believe that the world's wealth belongs to them by right, and a chromatic dragon seizes that wealth without regard for the humanoids and other creatures that have \"stolen\" it. With its piles of coins, gleaming gems, and magic items, a dragon's hoard is the stuff of legend. However, chromatic dragons have no interest in commerce, amassing wealth for no other reason than to have it.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"303\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Creatures of Ego</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></span> <p>Chromatic dragons are united by their sense of superiority, believing themselves the most powerful and worthy of all mortal creatures. When they interact with other creatures, it is only to further their own interests. They believe in their innate right to rule, and this belief is the cornerstone of every chromatic dragon's personality and worldview. Trying to humble a chromatic dragon is like trying to convince the wind to stop blowing. To these creatures, humanoids are animals, fit to serve as prey or beasts of burden, and wholly unworthy of respect.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"304\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Dangerous Lairs</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></span> <p>A dragon's lair serves as the seat of its power and a vault for its treasure. With its innate toughness and tolerance for severe environmental effects, a dragon selects or builds a lair not for shelter but for defense, favoring multiple entrances and exits, and security for its hoard.</p><p>Most chromatic dragon lairs are hidden in dangerous and remote locations to prevent all but the most audacious mortals from reaching them. A black dragon might lair in the heart of a vast swamp, while a red dragon might claim the caldera of an active volcano. In addition to the natural defenses of their lairs, powerful chromatic dragons use magical guardians, traps, and subservient creatures to protect their treasures.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"305\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Queen of Evil Dragons</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></span> <p>Tiamat the Dragon Queen is the chief deity of evil dragonkind. She dwells on Avernus, the first layer of the Nine Hells. As a lesser god, Tiamat has the power to grant spells to her worshipers, though she is loath to share her power. She epitomizes the avarice of evil dragons, believing that the multiverse and all its treasures will one day be hers and hers alone.</p><p>Tiamat is a gigantic dragon whose five heads reflect the forms of the chromatic dragons that worship her-black, blue, green, red, and white. She is a terror on the battlefield, capable of annihilating whole armies with her five breath weapons, her formidable spellcasting, and her fearsome claws.</p><p>Tiamat's most hated enemy is Bahamut the Platinum Dragon, with whom she shares control of the faith of dragonkind. She also holds a special enmity for Asmodeus, who long ago stripped her of the rule of Avernus and who continues to curb the Dragon Queen's power.</p></div></div><p>True dragons are winged reptiles of ancient lineage and fearsome power. They are known and feared for their predatory cunning and greed, with the oldest dragons accounted as some of the most powerful creatures in the world. Dragons are also magical creatures whose innate power fuels their dreaded breath weapons and other preternatural abilities.</p><p>Many creatures, including wyverns and dragon turtles, have draconic blood. However, true dragons fall into the two broad categories of chromatic and metallic dragons. The black, blue, green, red, and white dragons are selfish, evil, and feared by all. The brass, bronze, copper, gold, and silver dragons are noble, good, and highly respected by the wise.</p><p>Though their goals and ideals vary tremendously, all true dragons covet wealth, hoarding mounds of coins and gathering gems, jewels, and magic items. Dragons with large hoards are loath to leave them for long, venturing out of their lairs only to patrol or feed.</p><p>True dragons pass through four distinct stages of life, from lowly wyrmlings to ancient dragons, which can live for over a thousand years.

Her eyes burn with a cold blue light, and a thin cloak of mist forms around her. Blades of ice grow out of her body at odd angles, breaking off before they get too long. When she moves, her body crackles.</p><p>In this form, Auril creates weapons of ice with which to combat foes. These weapons are supernaturally resilient until Auril discards them, whereupon they break and melt like normal ice.</p></div></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--0\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--0\" data-title-index=\"121\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Auril the Frostmaiden</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></span> <p>Auril the Frostmaiden is a neutral evil lesser god of cold indifference who embodies winter's cruelty. (For information on what defines a lesser god, see the \"<a href=\"https://5etools-mirror-1.github.io/book.html#DMG,1,divine%20rank,0\">Divine Rank</a>\" sidebar in the <a href=\"https://5etools-mirror-1.github.io/book.html#DMG\">Dungeon Master's Guide</a>.) Auril's beloved ice grasps all things in her clutches, preserving them against the ravages of time. She hoards beauty in all forms, from art objects and flowers to skilled artisans and their wondrous works, freezing them in magical ice for her pleasure alone.</p><p>Auril was aligned with the gods Talos, Umberlee, and Malar. Together they wrought terrible destruction, inspiring fear that compelled tribute to hold their power at bay. Umberlee, queen of the wrathful sea, grew to despise the enduring nature of the ice and snow Auril created. Umberlee seethed when Auril's frigid cold transformed her chaotic, unpredictable tides into rigid, motionless sheets of ice. Umberlee brought Talos and Malar into an alliance against Auril, who retreated to the coldest corner of Toril to escape their fury.</p><p>After a world-shaking event known as the Sundering, most of the gods withdrew from Toril, leaving mortals to govern their own fates without the gods' meddling, but the Frostmaiden could not stay away for long. Auril returned to her icy realm in the far north and, after a time, plunged it into frigid darkness using her magic.</p><p>Casting such great magic night after night while also granting spells to her devoted followers leaves Auril weak and vulnerable. In her self-inflicted weakened state, Auril is inclined to be cautious and avoid contact with other creatures that can harm her.</p><p>Auril's worshipers know better than to disturb her self-imposed isolation. Terrible blizzards have cut off Icewind Dale from the rest of the world, and a shroud of mist conceals her island in the Sea of Moving Ice.</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"122\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Roleplaying Auril</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></span> <p>Portraying a deity, even a lesser god such as Auril the Frostmaiden, can be daunting. For roleplaying purposes, the following suggestions might prove helpful:</p><ul class=\"rd__list\"><li class=\"rd__li \">So long as she has mortal worshipers, Auril can't truly die (although the characters can rid the world of her for a time). Thus, she has no reason to capitulate to mortals' demands. As the embodiment of winter's cruelty, she is incapable of showing mercy or compassion. Play her as a supremely cold and unfeeling entity.</li><li class=\"rd__li \">Have Auril speak only when necessary. The less she talks, the less risk you have of unintentionally demystifying her in the eyes of your players. Let her actions, not her words, define her.</li><li class=\"rd__li \">Lesser gods in the D&amp;D multiverse are extremely powerful and arrogant, but also fallible and blind to their own flaws. It's appropriate for Auril to act as though she's invincible while underestimating her mortal enemies, even in her current weakened state.</li></ul></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"123\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Lair Actions</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></span> <p>Auril dwells on Solstice, a frozen island hidden among the titanic icebergs in the Sea of Moving Ice. Few creatures know of this island, let alone how to reach it. See <a href=\"https://5etools-mirror-1.github.io/adventure.html#IDRotF,15\">chapter 5</a> for information about the regional effects that encompass the island.</p><p>While she's on the island, the Frostmaiden can take one of the following lair actions on initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties):</p><ul class=\"rd__list\"><li class=\"rd__li \">Auril instantly knows the locations and health of all other creatures on the island. She knows how much damage each of these creatures has taken, how many levels of @condition[exhaustion] they have, and what conditions are affecting them currently.</li><li class=\"rd__li \">Auril instantly teleports to any location on the island. If the space she chooses as her destination is already occupied, Auril appears in the closest unoccupied space to it instead.</li><li class=\"rd__li \">Auril telepathically communicates with any number of creatures at once, provided they're all on the island. This effect lasts until Auril stops concentrating on it (as if concentrating on a spell) or until she leaves the island or uses a different lair action.</li></ul></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"124\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Auril's Three Forms</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></span> <p>In her current weakened state, Auril can assume three different forms. To destroy her, heroes must reduce each of her forms to 0 hit points one after another. After she's defeated in her third and final form, Auril dies. As long as she has mortal followers who worship her, however, Auril is reborn at full strength during the next winter solstice, with divine power far beyond what is reflected in the stat blocks presented here.</p><p>After finishing a long rest, Auril regains any of her forms that were destroyed, provided at least one form survives. When she transitions from one form to another, she loses all the traits and actions of the old form and gains those of the new form.</p><p>A stat block is given for each of Auril's three forms.

He has failed to produce another child with his wife, Wynneth, and his mistress, Froya, so the future of his royal line remains uncertain.</p><p>Auril's unyielding winter concerns Jarund deeply, and he often turns to his shaman, Mjenir, for guidance. The king respects the shaman's understanding of gods and spirits, and the fact that both men have lost their sons serves to strengthen the bond between them. Mjenir believes that the only way to break Auril's spell is to slay the goddess in her home, but Jarund believes that his warriors aren't strong enough to accomplish that task alone.</p></div>","public":""},"alignment":"neutral","race":"","type":{"value":"humanoid","subtype":"human","swarm":null,"custom":""},"environment":"","cr":5,"spellLevel":0,"xp":{"value":1800},"source":"IDRotF","class":{}},"traits":{"size":"med","di":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dr":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dv":{"value":[],"custom":""},"ci":{"value":[],"custom":""},"languages":{"value":["common","dwarvish"],"custom":""}},"currency":{"pp":0,"gp":0,"ep":0,"sp":0,"cp":0},"skills":{"acr":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"ani":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"arc":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"ath":{"value":1,"ability":"str","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"dec":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"his":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"ins":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"itm":{"value":1,"ability":"cha","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"inv":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"med":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"nat":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"prc":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"prf":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"per":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"rel":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"slt":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"ste":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"sur":{"value":1,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}}},"spells":{"spell1":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell2":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell3":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell4":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell5":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell6":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell7":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell8":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell9":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"pact":{"value":0,"override":null},"spell0":{"value":0,"max":0}},"bonuses":{"mwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"msak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rsak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"abilities":{"check":"","save":"","skill":""},"spell":{"dc":""}},"resources":{"legact":{"value":0,"max":0},"legres":{"value":0,"max":0},"lair":{"value":false,"initiative":20}}},"ownership":{"default":0,"PP5XOkXk6hNdYKV4":3},"prototypeToken":{"name":"Jarund Elkhardt","displayName":20,"actorLink":false,"width":1,"height":1,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"alpha":1,"light":{"alpha":0.5,"angle":360,"bright":0,"coloration":1,"dim":0,"luminosity":0.5,"saturation":0,"contrast":0,"shadows":0,"animation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5,"reverse":false,"type":null},"darkness":{"min":0,"max":1},"attenuation":0.5,"color":null},"disposition":-1,"displayBars":40,"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.hp"},"bar2":{"attribute":null},"flags":{},"randomImg":false,"texture":{"src":"assets/srd5e/img/IDRotF/Jarund Elkhardt.png","scaleX":1,"scaleY":1,"offsetX":0,"offsetY":0,"rotation":0,"tint":null},"sight":{"angle":360,"enabled":true,"range":0,"brightness":1,"visionMode":"basic","color":null,"attenuation":0.1,"saturation":0,"contrast":0},"detectionModes":[]},"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.0.1","coreVersion":"10.284","createdTime":null,"modifiedTime":1662383861805,"lastModifiedBy":"PP5XOkXk6hNdYKV4"}}

class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><p>A yeti's windborne howl sounds out across remote mountains, striking fear into the hearts of the scattered miners and herders that dwell there. These hulking creatures stalk alpine peaks in a ceaseless hunt for food. Their snow-white fur lets them move like ghosts against the frozen landscape. A yeti's icy simian eyes can freeze its prey in place.</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"273\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Keen Hunters.</span></span> <p>Folk of the high peaks travel in groups and go armed, knowing that yetis can smell living flesh from miles away. When it finds prey, a yeti moves quickly over ice and stone to claim its meal, howling to the thrill of the hunt. Even in a blizzard, the scent of its quarry draws the yeti through the cold and snow.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div><p>Yetis hunt in solitude or in small family groups. When creatures flee from a yeti or engage it in battle, other yetis might catch the scent of blood and close in. The territorial yetis fight one another for the spoils of such battles, and yetis slain in the fight are also eaten, amid euphoric howls.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"274\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Terrifying Howlers.</span></span> <p>Before an avalanche, a blizzard, or a deadly frost, the yetis' howls sweep down the mountain slopes on the icy wind. Some people of the alpine peaks believe that the voices of loved ones killed in avalanches and blizzards sound out in the wails of the yetis, crying warnings of ill omen. More pragmatic folk attest that the yeti's howl is a reminder that, despite the great accomplishments of civilization, the civilized become the hunted in nature's untamed domain.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"275\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Brutal Rampagers.</span></span> <p>When mountain herds are abundant, yetis stay clear of humanoid realms. Driven by hunger, they attack humanoid settlements in waves, breaking down gates and stockade walls that once might have daunted them, then devouring the creatures within.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div><p>Devious mountain folk sometimes use the yetis as unwitting weapons. A warlord might lay down slaughtered sheep or goats to draw yetis into an enemy's camp, sowing chaos and thinning the ranks before battle. Mountain clan chiefs, wanting to expand their territory, overhunt local game to diminish the yetis' food supplies, inspiring attacks on humanoid settlements that are swiftly annexed in the aftermath.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"276\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Abominable Yetis.</span></span> <p>An abominable yeti is larger than a normal yeti, standing three times as tall as a human. It typically lives and hunts alone, though a pair of abominable yetis might live together long enough to raise young. These towering yetis are highly territorial and savage, attacking and devouring any warm-blooded creatures they encounter, then scattering the bones across the ice and snow.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div></div></div></div>","public":""},"alignment":"chaotic evil","race":"","type":{"value":"monstrosity","subtype":"","swarm":null,"custom":""},"environment":"Arctic","cr":3,"spellLevel":0,"xp":{"value":700},"source":"MM","class":{}},"traits":{"size":"lg","di":{"value":["cold"],"custom":""},"dr":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dv":{"value":[],"custom":""},"ci":{"value":[],"custom":""},"languages":{"value":[],"custom":"Yeti"}},"currency":{"pp":0,"gp":0,"ep":0,"sp":0,"cp":0},"skills":{"acr":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"ani":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"arc":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"ath":{"value":0,"ability":"str","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"dec":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"his":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"ins":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"itm":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"inv":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"med":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"nat":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"prc":{"value":1,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"prf":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"per":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"rel":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"slt":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"ste":{"value":1,"ability":"dex","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}},"sur":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""}}},"spells":{"spell1":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell2":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell3":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell4":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell5":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell6":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell7":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell8":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell9":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"pact":{"value":0,"override":null},"spell0":{"value":0,"max":0}},"bonuses":{"mwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"msak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rsak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"abilities":{"check":"","save":"","skill":""},"spell":{"dc":""}},"resources":{"legact":{"value":0,"max":0},"legres":{"value":0,"max":0},"lair":{"value":false,"initiative":20}}},"ownership":{"default":0,"PP5XOkXk6hNdYKV4":3},"prototypeToken":{"name":"Yeti","displayName":20,"actorLink":false,"width":2,"height":2,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"alpha":1,"light":{"alpha":0.5,"angle":360,"bright":0,"coloration":1,"dim":0,"luminosity":0.5,"saturation":0,"contrast":0,"shadows":0,"animation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5,"reverse":false,"type":null},"darkness":{"min":0,"max":1},"attenuation":0.5,"color":null},"disposition":-1,"displayBars":40,"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.hp"},"bar2":{"attribute":null},"flags":{},"randomImg":false,"texture":{"src":"assets/srd5e/img/MM/Yeti.png","scaleX":1,"scaleY":1,"offsetX":0,"offsetY":0,"rotation":0,"tint":null},"sight":{"angle":360,"enabled":true,"range":60,"brightness":0,"visionMode":"basic","color":null,"attenuation":0.1,"saturation":0,"contrast":0},"detectionModes":[]},"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.0.1","coreVersion":"10.284","createdTime":null,"modifiedTime":1662383861808,"lastModifiedBy":"PP5XOkXk6hNdYKV4"}}
