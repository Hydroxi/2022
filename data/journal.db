Its buildings incorporate carvings of wizards, homunculi, tigers, and smiling djinn.</p>\n<p>For most visitors, the enchantment of the town is dispelled as soon as they feel the icy claws and teeth of the cold wind sweeping down from the north, shearing through their layers of clothing. Termalaine was built in the path of this dreadful gale, which continues well past the town to harry fishers on the southern half of the lake.</p>\n<p>In addition to fishers, shipbuilders, and scrimshanders, Termalaine is home to miners who harvest gemstones from a cavern complex set into a low hill north and east of the settlement. Their efforts are hampered by creatures from the Underdark that occasionally find their way up into the mine. Whenever such creatures are discovered, the mine is sealed off and the townsfolk wait until a band of sellswords or adventurers can be hired to clear it out.</p>\n<hr class=\"rd__hr rd__hr--section\" />\n<div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--0\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--0\" data-title-index=\"1314\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Termalaine in a Nutshell</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></span>\n<p><strong>Friendliness</strong> ❄❄❄<strong>Services</strong> ❄❄<strong>Comfort</strong> ❄❄❄</p>\n<div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\">\n<div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\">\n<div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"1315\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Available Quest.</span></span>\n<p>\"A Beautiful Mine\".</p>\n<div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"> </div>\n<ul class=\"rd__list rd__list-hang-notitle\">\n<li class=\"rd__li \">\n<p class=\"rd__p-list-item\"><span class=\"bold rd__list-item-name\">Population</span> 600.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"1316\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Leader.</span></span>\n<p>Oarus Masthew (lawful good half-orc @Actor[nMJxST9J7Aws2JrM]{scout}) was declared speaker after a close and contentious election.

Fifty years ago, a mysterious woman in a fur-lined red cloak stopped at the Eastside on her way to Lonelywood. Because the woman was alone and frightened, the innkeepers—a pair of retired adventurers who happened to be Marta's grandparents—tried to console her. The woman gave them a ring as payment for their hospitality. Not long afterward, a howling wind burst into the inn and tossed the woman about like a rag doll. The innkeepers intervened, giving the woman time to escape. The evil wind battered Marta's grandparents unconscious before resuming its hunt.

No one was killed, but the kobolds are too dangerous for the miners to deal with. He also reveals that a human miner went missing a few days before the kobolds showed up, prompting other miners to fear that a monster must have crawled up from the Underdark. Oarus thinks it's possible that the miner fell down the central shaft, which is deep enough that his body would never be found.</p>\n<p>One piece of information that Oarus fails to mention is that he ordered the town militia to clear out the mine three days ago. The militia refused to deal with the problem for what amounts to political reasons. Senior officers in cahoots with Speaker Naerth Maxildanarr of Targos are determined to oust Masthew as town speaker and replace him with one of their own in a special election.

She hopes to keep them in the grove for as long as possible. If the characters try to leave, Hathowyn tries to charm one of them into staying and keeping her company. The dryad knows the following information:</p><ul class=\"rd__list\"><li class=\"rd__li \">Netherese magic binds the dryad to the grove and keeps the trees alive.</li><li class=\"rd__li \">The pears hanging from the trees are magically delicious.</li><li class=\"rd__li \">Three dark elves have passed through the dryad's grove on multiple occasions, coming and going through the southwest and southeast passages (leading to areas H29 and H39). Hathowyn hasn't spoken to them out of fear that they might harm her.</li><li class=\"rd__li \">Strange, one-eyed creatures lurk in the cave to the south (area H37). They followed the dark elves up from below after their last foray down the southeast passage.</li></ul><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"2042\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Purple Pears.</span></span> <p>Each tree has [[/r 3d6]] ripe pears hanging from its branches, most of them within reach.

This chapter describes the fortress of Sunblight in detail, in the event the adventurers decide to attack it. But the characters are in for a surprise: by the time they arrive, Xardorok has already finished his construct and set it loose, leaving the characters with an agonizing decision: press the attack against the duergar fortress, or intercept the dragon in Ten-Towns.

The speaker would know the characters by reputation, if nothing else. At this meeting, the speaker presents the following information:</p><div class=\"rd__b-special rd__b-inset rd__b-inset--readaloud \"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2-inset rd__h--2-inset-no-name\"><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-special-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></span><p>\"Invisible enemies walk among us. We have seen their boot prints in the snow, and now we know what they are: duergar. These malevolent dwarves of the Underdark have infiltrated Ten-Towns in search of a rare crystal known as chardalyn. With it, they're building a mighty construct that will lay waste to Ten-Towns if nothing is done to stop it.</p><p>\"Our militia captured one of the duergar and forced it to divulge the location of their mountain stronghold. Therein you will find a duergar warlord named @Actor[tL8JHA0z9pJcAquS]{Xardorok Sunblight}. He aims to conquer Icewind Dale and destroy us all.

For the benefit of your players, you can point to the fortress's location using the poster map of Icewind Dale.</p><p>If the characters ask to speak with the captured duergar, the speaker informs them that the duergar was put to death following the interrogation, to keep him escaping and warning his kin. If the characters insist on seeing the duergar, the speaker takes them to a cellar where the body is being kept. Any character who casts a @Item[BvsvHRhFBO70esuZ]{speak with dead} spell on the dead duergar can validate the information that the speaker has already imparted.</p><p>The speaker has little to offer the characters as recompense beyond hospitality and friendship. If the characters insist on a more tangible reward, the speaker scowls, apologizes for misjudging them, and lets them go about their business. Their reputation takes a blow if they decline to help. Regardless of the meeting's outcome, the speaker's next task is to prepare the settlement for what will surely be the fight of its life, in the event that Xardorok's construct attacks Ten-Towns.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"1727\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Trouble in the Fortress</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></span> <p>The following sections describe what the characters are up against in this chapter.</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"1728\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Xardorok's Paranoia</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></span> <p>Xardorok's obsession with chardalyn is a form of madness that has consumed the duergar warlock, to the extent that he will stop at nothing to obtain all of it. Xardorok prizes chardalyn more than he loves his sons and his clan, which has alienated his closest advisors and forced them to question their blind obedience to him.</p><p>Prolonged contact with malevolent magic suffusing the chardalyn has made Xardorok extraordinarily paranoid. He keeps his two sons, Durth and Nildar, as far away from him as possible, sending them on dangerous missions to acquire more chardalyn in and around Ten-Towns, fearing that they might usurp his throne otherwise. Xardorok rewards his subjects for spying on one another and uncovering plots against him. The duergar closest to him are aware of the changes in his demeanor, but they lack the courage to stand up to him. A few have learned to capitalize on his paranoia, gaining Xardorok's favor by fabricating evidence of coups orchestrated by their rivals.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"1729\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">The Muzgardt Conspiracy</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></span> <p>@Actor[GPamA3NSsGQVdLNY]{Grandolpha Muzgardt}, the grand dame of the Muzgardt duergar clan, has recently arrived at the fortress after being invited here by Xardorok.

Xardorok has been eager to take a fourth wife and has had his eye on @Actor[GPamA3NSsGQVdLNY]{Grandolpha Muzgardt} for many years. He asked Grandolpha to his fortress to give her a gift—a pseudodragon made of chardalyn (a pseudo-pseudodragon, if you will)—and make her an offer she can't refuse. Once he conquers Icewind Dale, he wants the Muzgardts to control the ale trade throughout his sunless surface kingdom.</p><p>Grandolpha, for her part, is too canny and jaded to fall for Xardorok's blunt attempt at seduction. She has begun plotting with disenfranchised advisors and warriors in his ranks to overthrow him when the moment is right. Ironically, despite his paranoia, Xardorok is too blinded by his admiration for Grandolpha to foresee her treachery. In Grandolpha, the characters might find an unlikely (if temporary) ally.</p></div></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"1730\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Character Advancement</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></span> <p>In this chapter, characters can advance to 6th level and no farther.

Suddenly, great doors of ice previously hidden under snow stand open more than three hundred feet above you, and from between them flies a huge dragon made of dark ice. Its eyes glow with a bright golden light as it lets out a terrible roar, hurls itself into the air, and glides away from the fortress, then turns and heads north toward Ten-Towns.</p><div class=\"float-clear\"></div></div><p>The @Actor[C31JZMa0HP93AgKd]{chardalyn dragon} (see <a href=\"https://5etools-mirror-1.github.io/adventure.html#IDRotF,21\">appendix C</a>) exits the fortress by climbing up a shaft that leads from the forge level to the fortress's summit. The doors at the top of the shaft remain open until the dragon returns or until someone closes them by using the levers in areasX13 and X15.</p><p>The dragon stays at least 250 feet away from the party and does not pay any attention to the characters as it flies off on its mission to destroy Ten-Towns. Given the dragon's impressive flying speed, it's unlikely that the characters will be able to catch up to it.</p><p>The characters must now make a big decision: do they assault Xardorok's fortress as planned or follow the dragon back to Ten-Towns?

At the eastern end is a hexagonal stone table surrounded by six stone chairs. Seated in the chair facing the door is a haggard old duergar with long black hair streaked with ribbons of white and fingernails like shards of iron. She is devouring a hearty buffet of cooked meats, mushrooms, and strange Underdark fare. Lurking next to her is a small mechanical dragon made of a shiny black substance.</p><p>Hunched over a hot stove in the west side of the room are three duergar cooks. At the sight of you, they drop their utensils and reach for their weapons, but the old duergar says something in Dwarvish that keeps them at bay.</p><div class=\"float-clear\"></div></div><p>Xardorok and his sons dine here, occasionally joined by guests. In attendance today is Xardorok's paramour, @Actor[GPamA3NSsGQVdLNY]{Grandolpha Muzgardt} (see the accompanying stat block). The three @Actor[dGRw4O1s7GrhJGIr]{duergar} cooks are Grandolpha's loyal bodyguards. The chardalyn dragonet next to Grandolpha is a gift from Xardorok; it's a lawful evil construct that understands Draconic and Dwarvish but can't speak. It otherwise has the statistics of a @Actor[Zc3QofsWBeq8uVKV]{pseudodragon}.</p><p>After telling her bodyguards to stand down, Grandolpha invites the characters to join her for dinner. The main course is a cooked intellect devourer, its brain-body stewing in its own juices. The characters can partake of the feast that Grandolpha's guards have prepared, but the food has a thin layer of ash covering it that spoils the taste. Grandolpha doesn't seem to mind, though. She also offers the characters a vile Muzgardt brew made from Underdark mushrooms, which she pours from a jug on the table before her.</p><p>Grandolpha has no stake in Xardorok's plot to conquer Icewind Dale and does nothing to help or hinder his efforts. If the characters threaten her, she laughs at their audacity and refuses to meet their demands. If the characters ask for her help, she shares the following information with them:</p><ul class=\"rd__list\"><li class=\"rd__li \">She doesn't know Xardorok's current whereabouts but assumes he's in the forge (area X24) on the lowest level of the fortress.</li><li class=\"rd__li \">Xardorok has programmed his chardalyn dragon to follow a prearranged flight plan. The characters can view the dragon's route in Xardorok's war room (area X4).</li><li class=\"rd__li \">Xardorok is capturing Underdark monsters, which he plans to unleash upon Icewind Dale. He has also captured a myconid sovereign and is using its spores to reanimate corpses.</li><li class=\"rd__li \">Xardorok has proposed an alliance between his clan and the Muzgardt clan. Grandolpha is entertaining Xardorok's offer but hasn't agreed to anything. The mechanical pseudodragon was a gift from Xardorok, designed to win Grandolpha's affection.</li><li class=\"rd__li \">Given time, Grandolpha thinks she can turn most of the Sunblight duergar against Xardorok. Several of them have already pledged their loyalty to her.</li></ul><p>Before entering combat, Grandolpha casts @Item[35gYJfQzrvA3r3Wr]{stoneskin} on herself. Once her guards come to her rescue, she withdraws from combat and uses her @Item[QkXGniLY94od1Tz2]{faerie fire} spell to make enemies easier for her guards to hit. The chardalyn pseudodragon defends Grandolpha to the death.</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"1760\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Slaad Host.</span></span> <p>If a character has the Slaad Host secret (see <a href=\"https://5etools-mirror-1.github.io/adventure.html#IDRotF,20\">appendix B</a>) and has a @Actor[5vRTRAsFDdRBXbT7]{slaad tadpole} gestating inside them, having the tadpole burst out of the character's chest during dinner would be excellent timing for its shock value. Grandolpha suggests not killing the tadpole and instead proposes that it be allowed to grow into a full-sized slaad. \"Let Xardorok deal with it,\" she says. If the characters allow this to happen, the tadpole slinks away and finds a quiet corner of the fortress in which to grow, becoming a full-grown slaad within [[/r 2d12]] hours.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div><p></p><div class=\"float-clear\"></div><div><div class=\"rd__wrp-image relative\">\n\t\t\t<a href=\"https://5etools-mirror-1.github.io/img/adventure/IDRotF/150-637357081668773609.png\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" title=\"@Actor[GPamA3NSsGQVdLNY]{Grandolpha Muzgardt}\">\n\t\t\t\t<img class=\"rd__image\" src=\"https://5etools-mirror-1.github.io/img/adventure/IDRotF/150-637357081668773609.png\" />\n\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t</div><div class=\"rd__image-title\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rd__image-title-inner \">@Actor[GPamA3NSsGQVdLNY]{Grandolpha Muzgardt}</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</div></div><p></p></div></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"1761\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">X9.

When the myconid sovereign became uncooperative, Krob tore off one of its arms.</p><p>Thonot Krob uses the @Actor[vaY0qPgQsBhORNBp]{quaggoth} stat block with the modifications noted in the \"<a href=\"https://5etools-mirror-1.github.io/book.html#MM\">Variant: Quaggoth Thonot</a>\" sidebar in the <a href=\"https://5etools-mirror-1.github.io/book.html#MM\">Monster Manual</a>. He is joined in this room by four @Actor[vaaHOLssxCAuClzb]{quaggoth spore servants}. Krob and the spore servants fight to the death. If Krob dies, one of the spore servants uses its next action to pour its jug of spores over Krob's corpse, turning it into a new spore servant.</p><p>Sounds of combat here bring reinforcements from area X18 (four @Actor[dGRw4O1s7GrhJGIr]{duergar}) and area X20 (four @Actor[Yucl7y86W8gHJlhi]{quaggoths}). All the duergar, including Xardorok if he's present, use Enlarge before joining the fight. If defeat seems likely, Xardorok retreats to area X22 and uses the elevator to make his way toward area X8, where he hopes to enlist the aid of @Actor[GPamA3NSsGQVdLNY]{Grandolpha Muzgardt}, unaware of her true intentions. Grandolpha goes along with Xardorok but won't aid him in a fight, allowing the characters to kill him. If Xardorok is gravely wounded and Grandolpha can kill him without putting herself in harm's way, she seizes the opportunity.</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"1783\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Throne.</span></span> <p>Prolonged contact with Xardorok's chardalyn throne can warp one's mind.

The doppelganger tries to acquire some cold weather clothing and remains with the party until it reaches Ten-Towns. Once there, it slips away and adopts a new disguise. The doppelganger won't harm the characters unless they give it reason to.</p><p>The loud banging comes from an unarmed @Actor[xrLS2gEC75srOKGZ]{goliath warrior} named Kapanuk Talltree Thuunlakalaga.

Most of the town's buildings, which date back to the town's Cormyrean founders, line the path that winds down the steep slope from the Caer to the harbor, whose docks are perched on the rocky shore. Noteworthy places in town are marked on map 1.3, and map 1.4 shows the floor plan of the Caer.</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><p><span class=\"entry-title-inner\">The Caer</span><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></p><p><em>Castle residence of the town speaker</em></p><p>This small castle was built over four hundred years ago by the Dinev family from Cormyr, before Ten-Towns existed as anything more than a few scattered camps of explorers living off the land. The Dinevs hoped to claim sovereignty over the unsettled lands of Icewind Dale. When the castle, dubbed Caer-Dineval, was completed, the workers and their families settled in the outbuildings they had constructed farther down the cliff, along with the families of the retainers the Dinevs had brought with them. Over the next few years, many explorers in the region came to see the Caer for themselves, and some built cottages in the shadow of its walls. No sooner had the small town taken hold than marauding orcs swept down from the tundra to put it to the torch. The town's residents tried to take refuge in the castle, but the Dinevs, alarmed by the size of the orc horde, barred the gates and refused to open them. The orcs fell upon the stranded people and slaughtered them to the last one. The Dinevs survived the initial assault, but not the siege that followed. After three weeks of being confined in the Caer, the Dinevs were so weakened by hunger that they were unable to resist when the orcs scaled the castle walls. Thus, the Dinev family's brief rule in Icewind Dale came to a bloody end.</p><p>The Caer remained in the orcs' possession for several years, until they were driven out by a small army of human settlers from other parts of the dale who banded together. The victors claimed the castle and its lands, and those with families brought them here to settle. Their descendants live here to this day and keep alive the memory of their ancestors' deeds.</p><p>Today, the keep is the residence of the town speaker, Crannoc Siever, who recently made the mistake of opening his doors to the Knights of the Black Sword. This group consists of people from all walks of life who owe their lives to the archdevil Levistus (see \"Black Swords\" below for detailed descriptions of the castle and the cult of Levistus).</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><p><span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Dinev's Rest</span><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></p><p><em>Closed inn</em></p><p>At the south end of town is Caer-Dineval's inn, a drafty old building with boarded-up windows and a crooked weathervane shaped like a rearing dragon.

The Climb serves hot chowder but is all out of beer and spirits, which might explain why locals don't frequent the place as much as they used to. The proprietor, a rugged middle-aged man named Roark (lawful good human @Actor[SsRbRXUsnxODzjh5]{commoner}), blames the cursed winter and the closing of the Easthaven ferry for his business woes. Although he has spare rooms with empty beds, he claims to have no available guest accommodations. If adventurers are looking for a place to rest, he suggests that they try the Caer. Roark can't guarantee that Speaker Crannoc Siever's attendants will welcome them with open arms, given how sick the speaker has been of late.</p><p>Roark and some of his patrons know something is amiss in the castle, but they refrain from talking about it.

The quest falls into the party's lap if the characters decide to visit the Caer.

Devil-worshiping cultists calling themselves the Knights of the Black Sword have taken over and confined Crannoc to his quarters while spreading stories about the speaker's ill health to conceal their presence and restrict access to the castle. The cultists keep the speaker alive in case they need him to make a public appearance. They can also use him as a hostage if the Ten-Towners take up arms against them. These devil worshipers keep a low profile while seeking out new members to join their ranks.</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><p><span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Knights of the Black Sword</span><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></p><p>The Knights of the Black Sword are a secret society of cultists devoted to Levistus, the archdevil who rules Stygia, the sixth layer of the Nine Hells, from the confines of an ice prison from which he cannot escape.</p><p>Most of the cultists are Icewind Dale natives who would have perished in the wilderness had Levistus not intervened on their behalf. The cultists' stories are all the same: the archdevil reached out to them in their minds as they were freezing to death, offering a second chance at life in exchange for their absolute devotion. After they agreed to follow Levistus, a pale glow caught their eye in the snow nearby, leading to the discovery of a sword-shaped amulet of chardalyn. Each of these amulets has an inner radiance that provides warmth and aid, protecting its wearer against the cold while guiding them safely back to civilization. Once its wearer reaches Ten-Towns, the talisman loses its inner radiance, yet the cultists keep their amulets as signs of their devotion to the archduke of Stygia (see the \"Chardalyn Amulets\" sidebar).</p><p>The Knights of the Black Sword have members scattered throughout Ten-Towns. They welcome new members and answer to Levistus, who speaks to them infrequently using a powerful form of cross-planar telepathy. Levistus has recently called upon them to help another of their master's disciples—an albino tiefling wizard named @Actor[ZdyzgxiVqFXzU3AP]{Avarice}—achieve her goals. Even though they find her demanding and difficult to live with, they dare not defy her.</p><p>Levistus has warned the Knights of the Black Sword that duergar are plotting the destruction of Ten-Towns. He believes the duergar are acting on behalf of Asmodeus, the Lord of the Hells and his infernal jailer, but has not shared this information with the cult. The cult's oldest living member, Hethyl (a peg-legged shield dwarf who has lost her right foot to frostbite), hates duergar as most dwarves do. She has convinced the other cult members to forge alliances with anyone willing to oppose the duergar, including stray bands of adventurers.</p><p>The Caer serves as the cult's headquarters. The cult's presence is the worst-kept secret in Caer-Dineval, though few locals ever speak of it.</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><p><span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Game Statistics</span><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></p><p>The Knights of the Black Sword are lawful evil @Actor[RMayO7GSsp5DZanE]{cultists} and @Actor[hFTqq3tPsSONXEgY]{cult fanatics} who speak Common and Infernal.

From this usurped office, he coordinates all cult activities in Ten-Towns. It's a role he carved out for himself by asserting that he's tight with Levistus.

All of them are malnourished, since the cultists feed them only once every few days. The servants are briefly described below:</p><p><strong>Lanthis Alderdusk</strong> is Speaker Crannoc's 64-year-old assistant, notary, and scribe. He's feisty and spry for his age.</p><p><strong>Elprekt Norbrav</strong> is the effete, tall, skeletally thin, 55-year-old butler.</p><p><strong>Mylbara Norbrav</strong> is Elprekt's stout, 45-year-old wife and the speaker's Dwarvish translator.</p><p><strong>Tam Sharf</strong>, a mute, 30-year-old petty thief wanted for a murder in Luskan, is the speaker's housemaid.</p><p><strong>Dassir Ravenscar</strong> is the speaker's shy, 25-year-old dogkeeper.</p><p>These servants have decided to mount a prison break. When they hear the blue stone slab open in area C23, they hide. If the characters make their identities known before entering the room, the servants come forward and plead with the characters to free them. Otherwise, the servants try to ambush the first character to enter the room. They roll initiative as a group and make one grapple attempt only, with advantage on the [[/r d20]] roll. (Apply no modifiers to the roll.) If they fail to grapple the character, they scurry to the far corners of the room and huddle in defeat.</p></div></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><p><span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Outcome: Dark Alliance</span><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></p><p>Characters who forge a friendly relationship with the Knights of the Black Sword can use the Caer as a base of operations, coming and going for as long as this dark alliance lasts.

On the downside, captains who are brave enough to take their ships into the Sea of Moving Ice expect to be well compensated; characters can expect to pay 1,000 gp or more for a one-way trip to Auril's island, or five times that amount if they expect the ship to wait for them and take them back to Revel's End.</p><p>One such captain is Sharlasta Stormsword, a retired pirate (lawful evil human @Actor[OBYE8Jx2L39yG9o7]{bandit captain}) who commands the <i>Ravenous</i>, a sailing ship with a crew of twenty well-trained scalawags (@Actor[rqllHQcePIxagwZR]{bandits}). The ship's port of call is the city of Neverwinter. Despite her checkered past, Captain Stormsword is one of the most reliable privateers working for the Lords' Alliance today, and she rarely turns down a chance to earn a little extra coin on the side. Each dawn, she tosses a barrel of fish and a cask of whiskey into the sea as offerings to Umberlee—a practice that keeps the evil sea god on her side.</p><p>When the characters arrive at Revel's End, there's a [[/r 1d100]] (10 percent) chance that the <i>Ravenous</i> is moored at the pier and is in the process of offloading crates of supplies as well as [[/r 1d4]] convicts in shackles. Characters who aren't so lucky must wait [[/r 1d10]] days for the ship to arrive.</p><p>The <i>Ravenous</i> can travel 50 miles a day. But finding Auril's island while avoiding close encounters with icebergs and ice floes takes five days. Under no circumstances will Captain Stormsword or her crew leave their ship to explore the island.</p><p>If you need a map of the <i>Ravenous</i>, use the ship map in <a href=\"https://5etools-mirror-1.github.io/book.html#DMG,11\">appendix C</a> of the <a href=\"https://5etools-mirror-1.github.io/book.html#DMG\">Dungeon Master's Guide</a>.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"1888\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Via Griffons</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></span> <p>The goliaths of Skytower Shelter agree to loan the party members one griffon apiece if one of these conditions is met:</p><ul class=\"rd__list\"><li class=\"rd__li \">A goliath character who is a member of the Akannathi clan convinces the Akannathi chieftain to help the party by succeeding on a DC 13 Charisma (<span class=\"help help--hover\" data-plut-hover=\"true\" data-plut-hover-preload=\"true\" data-plut-hover-preload-id=\"311\">Persuasion</span>) check.</li><li class=\"rd__li \">The characters help to end the longstanding feud between the goliaths of Skytower Shelter and the goliaths of Wyrmdoom Crag.</li></ul><p>Skytower Shelter's griffons are safe to ride, but they are trained to return home after delivering the characters to their destination.

Characters who speak Aquan or Auran can communicate with Söpo verbally; if there's no one in the party who can understand it, the mephit communicates using gestures as best it can.</p><p>Söpo enjoys watching other creatures suffer. Initially, however, it acts as a guide to earn the characters' trust, pointing out areas where characters might slip on a patch of ice or get bonked on the head by a low-hanging icicle.

After stealing @Actor[dySXgvD0cNTqft0l]{Vellynne Harpell}'s @Item[hzQsdKlAnpeQ8aFT]{professor orb}, Nass fled to the coast to make her rendezvous with the pirate captain's galleon, the <i>Wicked Eddy</i>. The ship found Auril's island the hard way: by crashing into the ice shelf that runs beneath it. As the vessel took on water, Nass alone swam to shore, only to die of frostbite on a snow-covered bluff overlooking the <i>Wicked Eddy</i>'s sunken hulk.</p><p>Characters who search the northwest arm of the island find Nass's frostbitten corpse and much more:</p><div class=\"rd__b-special rd__b-inset rd__b-inset--readaloud \"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2-inset rd__h--2-inset-no-name\"><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-special-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></span><p>Half-buried in snow near the edge of a bluff is a humanoid corpse clad in cold weather clothing.

A voice rings out. \"Ye gods, I was afraid no one would find us!\" The sound isn't coming from the weasel, but from the orb.</p><div class=\"float-clear\"></div></div><p>If anyone tries to pry the orb from the dead wizard's fingers or otherwise disturbs the remains, @Actor[FCwuPKkOOCuPYPiA]{Nass Lantomir's ghost} (see appendix C) appears above the corpse and tries to possess someone on its first turn. If her ghost successfully possesses a party member, Nass tries to turn the characters against Vellynne (if she is present) and join them in their search for @Item[j8tDVg3eloi05U12]{The Codicil of White}. If the ghost gets what it wants, it shares the following information, some of which Nass acquired when she was alive with the aid of @Item[A08tVU156erUYWc5]{spell scrolls} of @Item[RvptMWpmgnPmMkhk]{divination} used before her death:</p><ul class=\"rd__list\"><li class=\"rd__li \">The Arcane Brotherhood sent four wizards to find the lost Netherese city of Ythryn, which has lain under the Reghed Glacier for nearly two thousand years.

If it's forced out of a host's body when the body is more than 200 feet from where Nass died, the ghost instantly returns to that spot, regardless of whether the wizard's corpse is still there.</p><p>If the ghost is reduced to 0 hit points, it fades away, only to reappear 24 hours later in the place where Nass died.

Each character who defiled a sculpture must succeed on a DC 20 Constitution saving throw or gain vulnerability to cold damage for the next 24 hours.

Because of her weakened state, the Frostmaiden can't create another such manifestation until the next dawn.</p><p>Second, Auril telepathically awakens Korgrah, an @Actor[cf2RzEBDGuJ2zCFz]{abominable yeti} (see area I5), and commands it to hunt down and kill the party.

Even if the party members take precautions on later days to avoid being separated, such as tying themselves together with rope, they discover that (if their group check fails) another one of their number goes absent. The disappearances continue until the Tiger nomads come back or until there is only one character left in the camp.</p><p>After six days and nights, Bjornhild and the surviving members of her camp return with several haunches of @Actor[CtMI2k0WmgDByvLE]{reindeer} meat loaded on dogsleds. Accompanying them are all the party members who went missing from the camp; the Tiger nomads found them, one by one, wandering in a daze.

In the course of this task, Isarr might stumble upon tracks left by the characters but continues his search of the outer tents, then does the same thing with the inner ring of tents, saving the chieftain's tent for last. By this time, if the characters haven't already engaged him, Isarr knows they're around and is looking forward to killing them as well and leaving their corpses as tribute to Malar the Beast Lord. If the characters attack Isarr, any @Actor[aktzdCuQipn9JKYG]{giant vultures} circling overhead join the fight as Isarr's allies.</p><p>To pass the Test of Preservation, the party members must keep Aerix alive so that his family's bloodline is preserved.

If the druids reach area G22 and are aware of the characters' presence, the druids seize @Item[j8tDVg3eloi05U12]{The Codicil of White} and try to escape with it, to keep it from falling into the hands of Auril's enemies.</p><p>In combat, the druids like to pelt enemies with @Item[LPOTuIQyAftxoA7N]{ice storm} spells or use their @Item[31viFE2vqpoOc6fN]{conjure animals} spells to summon @Actor[8Z9Px1tgMNIb6B17]{polar bears} (one bear per casting of the spell).

With this ulterior motive in mind, Vellynne offers the characters her sleds for traveling back to Ten-Towns and can easily be persuaded to help fight the dragon. (\"A wizard worth her weight never passes up a chance to test her magic against the mightiest foes,\" she says brazenly.)</p><p>There's room in the kobolds' sleds to transport the characters and their gear. If the characters insist on steering these sleds, the kobolds fuss about handing over the reins but do so, piling into the cargo beds. If the characters refuse to travel with the kobolds, Vellynne jettisons her little sidekicks without a second thought—the characters are much more valuable to her than the kobolds.</p><p>If the characters aren't sure where to go next, Vellynne suggests that they travel to the place where Ten-Towners are most likely to make their final stand against the dragon: the town of Bryn Shander. (Characters who found and studied Xardorok's attack plan in <a href=\"https://5etools-mirror-1.github.io/adventure.html#IDRotF,13\">chapter 3</a> might have a different idea.) If the characters take Vellynne's advice and head to Bryn Shander, they will be playing into Xardorok's hands. The dragon is saving Bryn Shander for last, because Xardorok knows that refugees from the smaller towns have nowhere else to go but there. Bryn Shander's walls provide no defense against the dragon's attacks from the sky, and the closer Ten-Towners huddle together, the easier it becomes for the dragon to annihilate them.</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"1826\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Roleplaying Vellynne</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></span> <p>Vellynne is a pragmatist who tries to stay one step ahead of her competition, in particular her rivals in the Arcane Brotherhood (of whom she rarely speaks).

Its residents aren't fond of visitors, and inbreeding has caused the population to dwindle in recent years. It also has given rise to often-seen physical deformities, including but not limited to small, misshapen ears and slightly pointed teeth.</p><p>The town is a small cluster of dwellings perched on the edge of Redwaters that is too small to support any industry—not even scrimshaw. Ice has buckled the shorter of its two piers, rendering the dock unsafe. The longer pier has two icebound keelboats tethered to it, though they're immobile because Auril's winter has frozen the surface of the lake for hundreds of yards around them. Local fishers have hauled their smaller boats onto the shore and resorted to cutting holes in the ice to catch knucklehead trout, which they depend on for survival. Visitors to Dougan's Hole are often struck by the eeriness of dark, humanoid shapes out on the ice, remaining silent and still as the wind howls around them.</p><hr class=\"rd__hr rd__hr--section\" /><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--0\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--0\" data-title-index=\"1108\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Dougan's Hole in a Nutshell</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></span> <p><b>Friendliness</b> ❄<b>Services</b> ❄<b>Comfort</b> ❄</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"1109\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Available Quest.</span></span> <p>\"Holed Up\".</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div><ul class=\"rd__list rd__list-hang-notitle\"><li class=\"rd__li \"><p class=\"rd__p-list-item\"><span class=\"bold rd__list-item-name\">Population</span> 50.</p></li></ul></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"1110\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Leader.</span></span> <p>Speaker Edgra Durmoot (neutral human @Actor[nMJxST9J7Aws2JrM]{scout}), a plainspoken trapper getting on in years, speaks for the townsfolk.

Years ago, a frost druid cast an @Item[bcu9EHHbJ6JfYzHo]{awaken} spell on the mammoth. Last year, a group of adventurers killed Garagai, the mammoth's frost giant master. Norsu has never recovered from the loss and, to this day, watches over its master's frozen corpse, unwilling to leave its side. The winter wolves, who served Garagai as faithful friends, look after the mammoth. Although Norsu feeds on plants, not meat, it delights in killing humanoids to avenge Garagai's death. Slaying the mammoth is a tall order, so characters would be wise to flee from Norsu or try to reason with it.</p><p>Norsu and the winter wolves reside in an ice lodge built by Garagai. The wolves try to entice the characters into the lodge, knowing that Norsu will enjoy the exercise of killing them. Held captive in the lodge are Silja and Finn Dejarr, two teenaged siblings from Dougan's Hole who have been missing for the past four days and are presumed dead. The wolves are holding the siblings in a cage and feeding them raw meat to keep them alive until Dougan's Hole pays a ransom for their safe return. Characters lured to the ice lodge by the wolves or hired by Speaker Durmoot to find the missing teenagers can try to rescue Silja and Finn from the frost giant's lodge and see them safely back to town.</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"1117\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Getting the Quest</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></span> <p>If Dougan's Hole is the starting town for this adventure, the characters already know some of what's going on.

Here's how the encounter plays out:</p><ul class=\"rd__list\"><li class=\"rd__li \">Koran acts as the \"good\" wolf while his brother plays the \"bad\" wolf. This act has worked before on the dim-witted locals; the wolves assume the characters will be fooled just as easily.</li><li class=\"rd__li \">Koran approaches the characters, limping on one back leg and whimpering like a pitiful dog, making himself as unthreatening as possible. Kanan remains nearby but out of sight. Any character who succeeds on a DC 15 Wisdom (<span class=\"help help--hover\" data-plut-hover=\"true\" data-plut-hover-preload=\"true\" data-plut-hover-preload-id=\"179\">Insight</span>) check sees through Koran's ruse, noticing how the wolf sometimes forgets which leg he's supposedly limping on.</li><li class=\"rd__li \">Koran claims that he was routinely kicked by his master, a mean old frost giant named Garagai. Koran also says that Garagai kidnapped two townsfolk and is holding them prisoner in his lodge more than half a day's walk west of town. Koran wants to help the characters free the prisoners, to get back at Garagai for his abuse. If the characters believe this story, Koran leads them to the lodge while Kanan follows their tracks and their scent, remaining out of sight.</li><li class=\"rd__li \">If Koran is unable to convince the characters to follow it back to the frost giant's lodge, Kanan steps in and plays the \"bad\" wolf, baring his fangs and threatening to eat the characters unless they change their minds. Kanan pretends to be upset about the abuse Garagai inflicted on Koran. \"He'll think twice before he hurts one of us again,\" Kanan says with a growl. As earlier, a successful DC 15 Wisdom (<span class=\"help help--hover\" data-plut-hover=\"true\" data-plut-hover-preload=\"true\" data-plut-hover-preload-id=\"180\">Insight</span>) check allows a character to ascertain that the wolf is lying.</li></ul><p>If the wolves can't trick or scare the characters into accompanying them to the frost giant's lodge thirteen miles west of Dougan's Hole, they drop their act and try to appeal to the characters' consciences. \"It's awfully cold in that lodge,\" says Koran, to which his brother adds, \"They won't suffer much longer. It's only a matter of time before Garagai skins and eats them.\" The wolves then bolt away, heading toward the lodge and leaving tracks that the characters can follow, if they choose not to accompany the wolves.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"1119\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Crossing the Tundra</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></span> <p>The wilderness around Dougan's Hole is a frozen tundra. Snow falls frequently, adding to the snowpack and erasing tracks. There is a [[/r 1d100]] (50 percent) chance that the characters get caught in a blizzard on the way to the lodge (see \"Blizzards\"). If Kanan and Koran are with the party, they protect the characters from the worst of the storm, using their bodies to shield the characters until it passes. The wolves' presence also prevents the characters from getting lost or separated.</p><p>Also crossing the tundra are a pack of [[/r 1d6 + 1]] @Actor[rMaDkbtGTnErYLMH]{wolves}, prowling the white in search of food. Characters who make a successful DC 13 Intelligence (<span class=\"help help--hover\" data-plut-hover=\"true\" data-plut-hover-preload=\"true\" data-plut-hover-preload-id=\"181\">Nature</span>) check note that the wolves are gaunt from starvation.

The wolves offer to stand guard outside while the characters enter the lodge and free the prisoners. Characters who suspect treachery can, with a successful DC 15 Wisdom (<span class=\"help help--hover\" data-plut-hover=\"true\" data-plut-hover-preload=\"true\" data-plut-hover-preload-id=\"182\">Insight</span>) check, tell that the wolves are lying about Garagai—the frost giant is in fact inside the lodge. Are they afraid to face their master, perhaps, or is there another reason why the wolves won't enter the lodge? No ability check can answer this question; the characters must find out for themselves! In truth, the winter wolves expect Norsu to slaughter the characters, but in case that doesn't happen, they remain outside to attack any characters who try to flee. (Specifically, the wolves wait in area L1, east of the lodge's main entrance.) If one wolf is slain, the other flees to avoid a similar fate.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"1121\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Lodge Locations</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></span> <p>The ice lodge was where Garagai lived and entertained other frost giants.

Mishann views Lathander as a usurper of Amaunator's light and doesn't like it when people confuse the two deities.</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"999\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Copper Knobberknocker.</span></span> <p>Mishann rents her attic to a pessimistic rock gnome tinkerer named Copper Knobberknocker (chaotic good rock gnome @Actor[iVsdM6rUTGMDlvUE]{acolyte} of Lathander), who begrudgingly helps with services and chores.

They hauled Ol' Bitey to the Northlook in the hope of having it cooked for them, but Scramsax bought it from them and had it stuffed instead. Years later, some prankster wizard cast a spell on the stuffed fish so that it turns and snaps at any creature that comes within 5 feet of it.

It begins when the characters learn about a group of shield dwarves who were forced to abandon a sled loaded with iron ingots, which they were transporting from the mines at the base of Kelvin's Cairn. The ingots belong to the Battlehammer clan and are stamped with the clan's iconic symbol, a foaming mug. The dwarves ask the characters to retrieve the sled and deliver the ingots safely to Blackiron Blades, for which each character will receive a gemstone as payment. Characters who complete this quest also earn a 10 percent discount on goods bought at Blackiron Blades—a little thank-you from the establishment's grateful owner.</p><p>Complications arise when goblins find the sled before the characters do. The characters must either fight the goblins or finagle the ingots from them using guile or stealth. To further complicate matters, the goblins have a wagon pulled by hungry polar bears. The bears aren't fussy about what they eat, so clever characters might think to turn them against the goblins.</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"1003\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Getting the Quest</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></span> <p>Three frostbitten shield dwarves approach the characters at the Northlook or in the snow-covered street:</p><div class=\"rd__b-special rd__b-inset rd__b-inset--readaloud \"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2-inset rd__h--2-inset-no-name\"><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-special-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></span><p>Three stocky figures bundled in cold weather garb stumble toward you.

Harnessed to this conveyance are two roaring polar bears that don't look happy.</p><div class=\"float-clear\"></div></div><p>These goblins were rolling across the tundra when their advance scout, a trained @Actor[cQb6zotWgAxHhaPn]{hawk}, spotted the abandoned sled. The one-eared @Actor[YLyddJfKW43WlWX1]{goblin boss}, Izobai, sent six @Actor[3bhYPNLwbT0Cn0gr]{goblins} forth to seize the sled and its cargo, while she and two @Actor[3bhYPNLwbT0Cn0gr]{goblins} stayed behind to guard the wagon and keep an eye on the two @Actor[8Z9Px1tgMNIb6B17]{polar bears} that pull it.</p><p>At the start of the encounter, the characters are 120 feet behind the sled, and the goblins' wagon is 120 feet farther still. The goblins hauling the sled are too distracted to notice they're being followed, so the characters have surprise.</p><p>The sled weighs 300 pounds, and the iron ingots add another 600 pounds of weight to it. A single goblin can push or drag 240 pounds, so it takes at least four of them to move the sled. If they come under attack, the goblins take cover behind the sled and retaliate with ranged attacks. On the goblins' first turn in combat, one of them blows a horn to alert Izobai, who climbs to the roof of the wagon with a lit torch in one hand and her hooded hawk perched on her other arm. From this perch, she watches the battle unfold. If she spots enemies within 60 feet of the wagon, she orders the two goblins inside the wagon to shoot arrows at these enemies through gaps in the wagon's walls. These two goblins have three-quarters cover.</p><p>If five or more goblins are killed, or if Izobai is killed or captured, the remaining goblins are willing to negotiate a truce, though it's up to the characters to initiate the negotiations. The goblins are prepared to give up the iron ingots in exchange for their lives and freedom.</p><p>The prolonged winter has made the goblins as miserable as everyone else in Icewind Dale. If the characters act kindly toward the goblins, by offering them a blanket or some other gift, the goblins give up the sled and the ingots and allow the characters to be on their way. The goblins hail from the fortress of Karkolohk (see \"Karkolohk\"). Their job is to scour the tundra for food and treasure, as well as creatures to enslave, but they are cold and eager to return home.</p><p>Izobai fights only in self-defense. If defeat seems inevitable, she uses her torch to set fire to the wagon and flees into the tundra with her hawk, her treasure (see below), and any goblins in the vehicle. The wagon contains goblin beds made of straw; they ignite quickly, turning the vehicle into a raging inferno by the start of Izobai's next turn.</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"1009\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Freeing the Bears.</span></span> <p>A character who succeeds on a DC 12 Wisdom (<span class=\"help help--hover\" data-plut-hover=\"true\" data-plut-hover-preload=\"true\" data-plut-hover-preload-id=\"164\">Animal Handling</span>) check can approach the polar bears without aggravating them and use an action to free one of them from its harness. On a failed check, both bears are hostile toward that character for the rest of the encounter. A freed polar bear does not attack the character who released it, but all other creatures on the battlefield are fair game. It would sooner eat a goblin than anything else, given how badly the goblins have treated the bears.

The brotherhood's leadership consists of five renowned archmages who handpick the other members, favoring wizards of great accomplishment. Every year, scores of wizards from across Faerûn flock to the Hosttower of the Arcane, hoping to gain admittance into the prestigious ranks of the brotherhood. Nearly all candidates are dismissed out of hand, without so much as a test, feeding rumors that the brotherhood's leaders are more interested in marketing their own brand of exclusivity than finding new talent. Yet wizards seem willing to debase themselves regardless, for admittance to the brotherhood grants access to the Hosttower's incredible libraries of magical lore.</p><p>The truth behind the brotherhood's ongoing quest for new members is based on the adage, \"Keep your friends close and your enemies closer.\" The brotherhood's leaders seek out wizards who might by their exploits compete with the brotherhood's acquisition and hoarding of arcane lore and magical secrets. By bringing these wizards into the fold, the brotherhood turns potential enemies into colleagues, in effect neutralizing future threats.</p><p>Once welcomed into the brotherhood, wizards are free to pursue their own interests so long as they place the security and sanctity of the Hosttower and the cabal above all else. When not rallying to defend their home, wizards of the Arcane Brotherhood act like friendly and unfriendly rivals to one another, striving to outdo their peers in magic. Open conflict between members is forbidden, yet members are adroit at finding underhanded ways to needle and sabotage one another.</p><p>The Arcane Brotherhood sent three of its members to investigate rumors of a lost Netherese enclave that crashed in Icewind Dale nearly two thousand years ago. A fourth wizard, Nass Lantomir, learned about the expedition and decided to form her own.</p><p>Not long after they arrived in Bryn Shander, the three wizards who had formed the initial expeditionary force parted company, each one determined to be the first to find the enclave—such is the fragile nature of wizardly alliances. The four wizards are described below:</p><p>@Actor[ZdyzgxiVqFXzU3AP]{Avarice}, an albino tiefling evoker with a pair of gargoyle companions</p><p>@Actor[1BMPDdTIo0dt3m2x]{Dzaan}, a human illusionist and Red Wizard of Thay who perished recently, but whose simulacrum lives on</p><p>@Actor[FCwuPKkOOCuPYPiA]{Nass Lantomir}, a human diviner who died and now exists as a spellcasting ghost</p><p>@Actor[dySXgvD0cNTqft0l]{Vellynne Harpell}, a human necromancer from a famous family with a cadre of kobolds—some living, others undead</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"2210\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Goliaths</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></span> <p>At the highest mountain peaks—far above the slopes where trees grow, where the air is thin and the frigid winds howl—dwell the reclusive goliaths. Few other folk can truthfully claim to have seen a goliath, and fewer still to have forged a friendship with one.</p><p>Goliaths love to compete and keep score, counting up their deeds and tallying their accomplishments to compare to what others have done. Goliaths love to win, but they see defeat as an incentive to improve their skills. Above all else, every goliath is driven to outdo their past performance, taking greater and greater risks.

He has led the Elk Tribe for over half his life, and age has made him cautious. He has seen other kings and queens rise and fall, has made war with friends and peace with his enemies, and has led warriors he knew as babes to their deaths in battle. The strain of his long years of rule is etched on his weather-worn face.</p><p>Jarund's late son, Jarund Twice-Born, was killed almost a decade ago while trying to bring down a cave bear, leaving Jarund without an heir. He has failed to produce another child with his wife, Wynneth, and his mistress, Froya, so the future of his royal line remains uncertain.</p><p>Auril's unyielding winter concerns Jarund deeply, and he often turns to his shaman, @Actor[6WAF2jTBBMxAh797]{Mjenir}, for guidance. The king respects the shaman's understanding of gods and spirits, and the fact that both men have lost their sons serves to strengthen the bond between them. @Actor[6WAF2jTBBMxAh797]{Mjenir} believes that the only way to break Auril's spell is to slay the goddess in her home, but Jarund believes that his warriors aren't strong enough to accomplish that task alone.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"2225\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Tribe of the Tiger</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></span> <p>The Tiger Tribe shuns the stronger Elk Tribe and preys on the weaker Bear and Wolf tribes.

The characters can also counteract the Frostmaiden's everlasting winter by using the @Item[LpiVj9Lcu3RMtOEq]{Ythryn mythallar} to effect a change in the weather, though any such attempt inevitably leads to a confrontation with Auril and her faithful. Only by slaying Auril can the characters deprive her followers of their god-granted spells and their will to fight.</p><p>With the Frostmaiden's defeat, normal seasonal weather returns to Icewind Dale. The sun again rises above the horizon, and as temperatures improve, flora and fauna begin to recover. Depending on how they fared against the chardalyn dragon in <a href=\"https://5etools-mirror-1.github.io/adventure.html#IDRotF,14\">chapter 4</a>, the people of Ten-Towns can look forward to warmer times once more.</p><p>Auril's death is temporary, for a god who has mortal worshipers can't truly die. When the Frostmaiden is resurrected on the next winter solstice, she has all her divine power. But her inclination is to retreat from the world and not allow herself to be imperiled by mortals once more. The characters won't have to deal with her again in their lifetimes unless they continue meddling in her followers' affairs.</p><p>The characters can help Ten-Towners rebuild their settlements in the wake of the chardalyn dragon's rampage and the floods. If the dragon has not yet been defeated, finding and destroying it should be a priority. Until its master sends it on another rampage, it lurks inside the forge where it was created (see <a href=\"https://5etools-mirror-1.github.io/adventure.html#IDRotF,13\">chapter 3</a>).</p><p>Characters who help rebuild Ten-Towns might be asked to take up the mantle of speaker in one or more communities, replacing leaders who were killed during the adventure. If he survived, Speaker Naerth Maxildanarr of Targos opposes the characters' political ascendance, since they represent a threat to Zhentarim control of the region; without a power base of his own, however, Naerth can do little to stop them.</p><p></p><div class=\"float-clear\"></div><div><div class=\"rd__wrp-image relative\">\n\t\t\t<a href=\"https://5etools-mirror-1.github.io/img/adventure/IDRotF/191-08-001.end-of-winter.png\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" title=\"The end of winter signals a resurgence of life in Icewind Dale\">\n\t\t\t\t<img class=\"rd__image\" src=\"https://5etools-mirror-1.github.io/img/adventure/IDRotF/191-08-001.end-of-winter.png\" />\n\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t</div><div class=\"rd__image-title\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rd__image-title-inner \">The end of winter signals a resurgence of life in Icewind Dale</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</div></div><p></p></div><hr class=\"rd__hr rd__hr--section\" /><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--0\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--0\" data-title-index=\"2187\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Winter Everlasting</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></span> <p>If the characters don't stop Auril, her everlasting winter becomes unendurable to most of Icewind Dale's inhabitants. The hostile climate and the scarcity of food force indigenous creatures to migrate southward or die. As go the @Actor[CtMI2k0WmgDByvLE]{reindeer}, so go the Reghed tribesfolk. In time, even the lakes freeze solid, depriving Ten-Towners of the knucklehead trout upon which their survival depends. Within a year or two, Icewind Dale becomes a gods-forsaken wasteland as cold as Stygia. The bitter cold allows Levistus to open portals between Icewind Dale and the sixth layer of the Nine Hells, from which come forth ice devils under the archdevil's command. Knights of the Black Sword who survive to see these events come to pass try to maintain a foothold in the region, though they are opposed by duergar at every turn.</p><p>The ice devils help clear the way for the duergar, who aren't going anywhere unless the characters kill @Actor[tL8JHA0z9pJcAquS]{Xardorok Sunblight} and put an end to his line. Once Ten-Towns is no longer a threat to his supremacy, Xardorok does his utmost to conquer the rest of Icewind Dale. If left unchecked, the duergar become a controlling power in the region. The ice devils, once subservient to Levistus, are dragooned by Asmodeus into helping the duergar turn the Far North into a vassal kingdom secretly under the sway of the Nine Hells.</p></div><hr class=\"rd__hr rd__hr--section\" /><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--0\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--0\" data-title-index=\"2188\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Year of Chilled Marrow</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></span> <p>If the characters use Iriolarthas's @Item[9Ik0KZXogPQrHceQ]{staff of power} to activate the obelisk in Ythryn, they inadvertently reset the world to a time predating the fall of Ythryn and the end of Netheril. The obelisk has sent them back to the spring of −343 DR, the Year of Chilled Marrow, six months prior to the catastrophe that causes Ythryn's fall and another four years before Netheril's demise. The characters find themselves high in the sky over Icewind Dale. Use the following boxed text to set the scene:</p><div class=\"rd__b-special rd__b-inset rd__b-inset--readaloud \"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2-inset rd__h--2-inset-no-name\"><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-special-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></span><p>The obelisk is gone, leaving an indentation in the ground where it once stood. In its place is an aarakocra with brilliantly colored plumage. Using telepathy, it reaches out to each of you in turn and introduces itself as Necalli. \"I am released from a duty long forgotten,\" it says. \"The world has rolled back more than fifteen hundred years. Now, history can be rewritten.\"</p><p>The city is no longer trapped deep beneath the Reghed Glacier. Instead, it drifts among the clouds, its spires and other structures agleam and undamaged. A skycoach glides overhead, bathing you briefly in its shadow before making its way toward the city's glass-enclosed skydock.</p><p>Weaving between the city's spires are boulevards traversed by tall humans of noble bearing in wizardly robes, many of them accompanied by hairless, green-skinned humanoids that serve as their valets and bodyguards. Some take note of your presence, while others gawk at the empty space where the obelisk once stood.</p><div class=\"float-clear\"></div></div><p>Necalli, a @Actor[Kel8wwDZbiYOhRIx]{couatl} shapechanged into the form of an aarakocra, doesn't remember why it was bound to the obelisk or by whom. It knows only that it is free of its obligation to the obelisk's builders. It does its best to convince the characters that the obelisk is gone forever, along with nearly two thousand years of history. Necalli can administer healing to wounded characters, after which it assumes its true form and departs. It takes no action that might harm another creature.</p><p>Ythryn is now a floating, living city under the rule of the @Actor[63KlIB4CmiL9RnDg]{lich} Iriolarthas and his apprentices, the Wizards of the Arcane Star (eight evil @Actor[6dOrI3AHnjWpZTvo]{archmages}). Almost every other inhabitant of the city is either a Netherese @Actor[IWFSDeAdZPgl9isQ]{mage} or a green-skinned magen (described in appendix C). When not partaking in their studies and revels, the Netherese focus their efforts on finding ruins of Ostoria, the ancient empire of giants. It is toward this supreme goal that all of the city's resources are directed.</p><p>The obelisk is gone, erased from history, leaving the characters stranded. They are now stuck in −343 DR. If the characters warn Iriolarthas about the fate that awaits Ythryn and recount the circumstances leading to its fall, the lich takes steps to ensure that history does not repeat itself, including but not limited to keeping Ostorian relics away from the @Item[LpiVj9Lcu3RMtOEq]{Ythryn mythallar}. In exchange for their information, Iriolarthas gives the characters a skycoach to expedite their departure from the city. Characters who flee rather than allow themselves to be detained can commandeer a skycoach and plot a course away from the city. A skycoach has the statistics of an @Item[ib3dtTY2Pi9phl51]{airship} (see the <a href=\"https://5etools-mirror-1.github.io/book.html#DMG\">Dungeon Master's Guide</a>), but its magic wanes quickly unless it's recharged using magic foreign to the characters. Soon, the skycoach struggles to remain aloft, forcing the characters to set down and salvage what they can from the vessel.</p><p>To put it mildly, the characters have a whole new world to explore. Ten-Towns doesn't exist in this timeline, nor do most of the cities along the Sword Coast that characters might recognize. Many tribes of Reghed nomads prowl Icewind Dale, while Uthgardt tribes descended from Netherese claim vast tracts of untamed land south of the Spine of the World, kept in check by marauding monsters. The Empire of Netheril controls the lush, temperate lands doomed to become the desert of Anauroch. The town of Illusk (still centuries away from becoming Luskan) surrounds the brooding Hosttower of the Arcane. Characters hoping to visit some past version of Waterdeep or Neverwinter find nothing but unsettled land surrounded by the remnants of the elven kingdom of Illefarn. Humans won't begin farming the plateau above Deepwater Harbor (the future site of Waterdeep) or building the settlement of Eigersstor (later renamed Neverwinter) for another three centuries.</p><p>To run a campaign set in this earlier time frame, you will need to delve into earlier products tied to the Forgotten Realms to get the lay of the land circa–343 DR. Of course, once the characters move beyond the strongholds of civilization, the Realms of the past is very much like the Realms of the present—a land of mystery, with old ruins and lost dungeons waiting to be explored. Only now the characters are poised to witness the inevitable fall of Netheril, or find a way to stop it.</p></div></div></div>"},"_id":"376KxCJksIm0ovkU","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"ownership":{"default":0,"PP5XOkXk6hNdYKV4":3},"_stats":{"systemId":null,"systemVersion":null,"coreVersion":null,"createdTime":null,"modifiedTime":null,"lastModifiedBy":null}}

Caer-Konig started as a camp for a group of mountaineers from the northern Moonsea region. As the camp grew, a wooden palisade was added to discourage raiders. Later came the stone castle of Caer-Konig. Alas, neither the palisade nor the castle fared well; both fell to orcs before falling into ruin.</p><p>Caer-Konig as it is known today consists of terraced rows of houses that recede from the shore of Lac Dinneshere like the tiers of an amphitheater. The harbor is frozen, its docks skewed and broken by the shifting ice. Buried under the snow on the slopes above the last row of houses are the ruins of the Caer that gave the town its name—a reminder to the people of Caer-Konig that nothing lasts in this corner of the world.</p><p>Travel to and from this remote town was expedited by the ferry that ran out of Easthaven, but with the ferry shut down, Caer-Konig is completely cut off by mountains, lake, and snow. Forced to live on what they can haul out of the iced-over lake, the people of Caer-Konig are bitter and angry. They believe that the rest of Ten-Towns has abandoned them. The only thing that keeps the townsfolk from leaving is the beer at the local tavern, which never seems to run out.</p><p>As if things weren't bad enough, the town has suffered several mysterious break-ins recently, with no evidence of the intruders except dwarven boot tracks in the snow leading north. Since there are no known settlements in that direction, the townsfolk assume that Auril's everlasting winter has taken its toll on the dwarves of Kelvin's Cairn, forcing them to come down from the mountain in search of food or beer. In truth, the town is beset by @condition[invisible] duergar searching for chardalyn.</p><p>The town speaker, a heavy-drinking dragonborn named Trovus, patrols at night to keep an eye out for trouble.

He has no recollection of how he ended up in the snow pile or why he was outside drinking in the first place.</p><p>If he's asked about the thieves, Trovus takes a deep breath, trying to suppress his hiccups, before explaining the situation:</p><div class=\"rd__b-special rd__b-inset rd__b-inset--readaloud \"><p><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-special-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></p><p>\"The town has had some thievery troubles.

The other owner, Cori, is working in the kitchen. Allie settles Trovus into a chair before approaching the characters.</p><p>She confirms that the town has been experiencing break-ins and robberies lately, but no one has witnessed a potential culprit. The only clue is a set of tracks leading in the direction of Kelvin's Cairn. Allie thinks the tracks were made by dwarves who live in the valley at the base of Kelvin's Cairn. She suspects that the endless winter has made the dwarves desperate for food and ale, though she can't explain why the dwarves would steal the inn's lantern and other valuables. Allie is also surprised that no one in Caer-Konig has seen or heard the dwarves, remarking that \"A quiet dwarf is an oxymoron.\"</p><p>Any interaction with Allie is interrupted when Cori exits the kitchen:</p><div class=\"rd__b-special rd__b-inset rd__b-inset--readaloud \"><p><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-special-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></p><p>The door to the kitchen swings open as a stern-looking woman enters holding a steaming bowl of soup.

Besides, what use do hungry dwarves have for a lantern?\"</p><div class=\"float-clear\"><p> </p></div></div><p>If the characters ask Cori for details, she explains that the magic lantern that used to decorate the outside of their inn doesn't do anything useful other than light up the area with different colors.</p><p>If asked about a reward for dealing with the thieves, the sisters say they have little coin, but they can provide food and comfortable beds in exchange for the party's help. They'll even throw in a few flagons of beer if the characters can bring their magic lantern back to the inn.</p><p>If the characters accept the quest, Allie takes them to the back of the inn, where faint footprints lead toward Kelvin's Cairn.

If the characters do so, they discover that Jarthra, the mountain guide at Frozenfar Expeditions, is willing to accompany the characters for a small fee of 10 gp per day of travel. Jarthra has advantage on Wisdom (<span class=\"help help--hover\" data-plut-hover=\"true\" data-plut-hover-preload=\"true\" data-plut-hover-preload-id=\"169\">Survival</span>) checks made in the vicinity of Kelvin's Cairn.</p></div></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><p><span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Following the Tracks</span><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></p><p>The tracks leading away from the inn have been partly filled with blowing snow, making them appear as small depressions. Once the characters get about 50 feet away from the inn and its outbuildings, they discover that the tracks have been completely obscured.</p><p>If the characters wait until morning to set out, they find a set of fresh footprints left behind by a lone duergar scout. This duergar didn't enter any buildings, but simply looked around the village before leaving close to morning. Following the footprints leads to a different set of tracks, which were made by an ogre zombie pulling a dogsled. These new tracks begin where the duergar tracks end, a quarter-mile outside of town. (The ogre zombie waited all night for the duergar to return. The duergar hopped onto the dogsled before ordering the ogre zombie to march.) Any character who examines these tracks and succeeds on a DC 15 Wisdom (<span class=\"help help--hover\" data-plut-hover=\"true\" data-plut-hover-preload=\"true\" data-plut-hover-preload-id=\"170\">Survival</span>) check identifies the creature tracks as belonging to an ogre. The characters can follow these fresh tracks, which head toward the mountain and then veer toward the duergar outpost hidden in the northeastern foothills of Kelvin's Cairn.</p><p>Once the characters get within a mile of the outpost, they discover that the wind has erased the tracks they've been following, making it difficult for them to find the exact destination. For every hour the characters spend searching the foothills, have them make a DC 15 Wisdom (<span class=\"help help--hover\" data-plut-hover=\"true\" data-plut-hover-preload=\"true\" data-plut-hover-preload-id=\"171\">Survival</span>) group check. Jarthra contributes to this group check, if she's present, and has advantage on her roll. If the group check succeeds, the characters find the outpost. If the group check fails, they didn't find the outpost during that hour but can try again. If they fail two of these group checks in a row, the characters have a random encounter in the wilderness, possibly during a blizzard (see \"Wilderness Encounters\").</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><p><span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Approaching the Outpost</span><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></p><p>The duergar outpost, a recent addition to the foothills north of Kelvin's Cairn, was carved out of a hillside.

This icy land of windswept tundra recently became locked in a perpetual, dark winter without reprieve. Auril the Frostmaiden, the divine embodiment of winter's fury, has withdrawn to this cold corner of the world to live among mortals. Further, she has cast a terrible spell over Icewind Dale, to the detriment of most of its denizens.</p>\n<p>Each night before midnight, Auril takes to the sky on the back of a white roc and weaves her spell, which manifests as a shimmering curtain of light—a beautiful aurora that illuminates the night sky and fades before dawn. This powerful magic prevents the next day's sun from rising above the horizon, turning midday into twilight and trapping Icewind Dale in winter's dark embrace, with no sunlight or warmth to melt the snow and ice. Each casting of the spell leaves the Frostmaiden weakened, with just enough divine power left to barricade the mountain pass with blizzards and churn the Sea of Moving Ice with blistering winds. Such measures discourage travelers from approaching or leaving Icewind Dale, further isolating the region. Icewind Dale has thus been trapped in a different reality from the rest of the world, for though the sun never rises over the dale, it continues to rise everywhere else.</p>\n<p>The people of Icewind Dale know Auril's wrath when they feel it, and they have a name for the unending winter she has inflicted on them. They call it the Everlasting Rime. No one understands why the Frostmaiden has imposed her will in this way or why the other gods refuse to challenge her. This prolonged winter, which has gone on for more than two years, threatens to doom not just the flickering lights of civilization known as Ten-Towns but also the indigenous flora and fauna that need sunlight and the change of seasons to survive.</p>\n<p>Not all creatures are discouraged by what has transpired north of the Spine of the World. The long nights and sunless days are a blessing to @Actor[tL8JHA0z9pJcAquS]{Xardorok Sunblight}, a duergar who longs to carve out a domain for himself on the surface and enslave the people of Ten-Towns in the process. Already, he has taken advantage of Auril's magic and raised a fortress amid the dark shadows of the mountains. From here, his underlings strike out across the tundra in search of chardalyn—a crystalline substance known to exist only in Icewind Dale. Once he gathers enough of it, Xardorok plans to construct a chardalyn dragon and unleash it upon Ten-Towns.</p>\n<p>Despite Auril's blizzards and other deterrents, visitors still come and go. Among the recent arrivals are four wizards of the Arcane Brotherhood, a powerful society of spellcasters based in Luskan. They've come chasing rumors of a lost city buried under the Reghed Glacier—a fragment of the long-gone Empire of Netheril, whose wizards wielded magic that terrified the gods. Netherese magic has a way of attracting power-hungry wizards, as members of the Arcane Brotherhood often are. The cities of Netheril floated among the clouds, making them almost impervious to assault for centuries. Then, nearly two thousand years ago, this floating city crashed during the fall of the empire, and no one has found or explored it since. It is, arguably, Icewind Dale's greatest secret—a necropolis of Netherese wizards and the magic they left behind. What survived the crash is anyone's guess, but we're about to find out!</p>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"float-clear\"> </div>\n<div>\n<div class=\"rd__wrp-image relative\"><a title=\"Two young children from Lonelywood go ice fishing on Maer Dualdon\" href=\"https://5etools-mirror-1.github.io/img/adventure/IDRotF/000-00-000.intro-splash.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> <img class=\"rd__image\" src=\"https://5etools-mirror-1.github.io/img/adventure/IDRotF/000-00-000.intro-splash.jpg\" /> </a></div>\n<div class=\"rd__image-title\">\n<div class=\"rd__image-title-inner \">Two young children from Lonelywood go ice fishing on Maer Dualdon</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p> </p>\n<hr class=\"rd__hr rd__hr--section\" />\n<div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--0\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--0\" data-title-index=\"864\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">About This Book</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></span>\n<p><em>Icewind Dale: Rime of the Frostmaiden</em> is a Dungeons &amp; Dragons adventure optimized for four to six characters.

His sons, Durth and Nildar, lead teams of duergar on quests to retrieve more of this dark-colored crystal for their grasping, despotic father.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"868\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Netherese Necropolis</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></span>\n<p>The wizards of bygone Netheril wielded magic that could reshape the world.

When this tower was destroyed, the magic used to create it fused with the surrounding ice to form what is now known as chardalyn: a nonmagical, crystalline substance as strong as metal, though considerably easier to work with than steel. In the years since, more deposits of chardalyn have been found across Icewind Dale. Like the <em>Crystal Shard</em>, these deposits tend to be suffused with demonic magic. Prolonged contact with chardalyn that has become suffused with demonic magic can warp a creature's mind, causing madness that usually fades away once the contact is broken.</p>\n<p>Chardalyn is cold to the touch and readily accepts magical enchantment, making it an ideal substance for wands, staffs, and other magic items. A chardalyn object suffused with the magic of the Upper Planes is considered a consecrated object, while a chardalyn object suffused with the magic of the Lower Planes is considered a desecrated object; both can be identified as such using a @Item[9YGzysWMGfMbJhMj]{detect evil and good} spell or similar magic.</p>\n<p>Long before Akar Kessel left his mark on Icewind Dale, Netherese wizards created their own chardalyn. Many items made from this dark-colored crystal can be found in the ruins of ancient Netherese enclaves.</p>\n<div class=\"float-clear\"> </div>\n</div>\n<p>Four members of the Arcane Brotherhood (a cabal of wizards who act like Wild West gunslingers) have come to Icewind Dale in search of the lost Netherese enclave, hoping to unearth its secrets. Whether the characters choose to aid or oppose these wizards is up to them, but one thing is certain: the Arcane Brotherhood won't let a band of adventurers stand between them and the magic that waits to be found in the doomed, sepulchral ruin.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"870\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Auril's Everlasting Rime</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></span>\n<p>Auril's decision to live among mortals is explained in <a href=\"https://5etools-mirror-1.github.io/book.html#idrotf,21\">appendix C</a>. What the characters discover in the course of the adventure is that she's unhappy and craves isolation. Her nightly quest to hold the sun at bay stems from a need to preserve the beauty of things by freezing them. There is no way to reason with a being so bereft of compassion as Auril, but in her weakened state, she can be defeated or forced to reckon with her cruel indifference toward life.</p>\n<p>Anyone who hopes to reach the Netherese city buried in the ice must first visit Auril's island and obtain @Item[j8tDVg3eloi05U12]{The Codicil of White}, a book compiled by the Frostmaiden's most ardent followers. The tome contains a magical incantation written as a poem.

In the Realms, knights dare to seek out the crypts of the fallen dwarf kings of Delzoun, looking for glory and treasure. Rogues prowl the dark alleyways of teeming cities such as Neverwinter and Baldur's Gate. Clerics wield mace and spell in the service of their gods, questing against the terrifying powers that threaten the land. Wizards plunder the ruins of the fallen Netherese empire, delving into secrets too dark for the light of day. Bards sing of kings, queens, tyrants, and heroes who died long ago.</p>\n<p>On the roads and rivers of the Realms travel minstrels and peddlers, merchants and guards, soldiers and sailors. Steel-hearted adventurers from backcountry farmsteads and sleepy villages follow tales that take them to strange, glorious, faraway places. Good maps and clear trails can carry even an inexperienced youth with dreams of glory far across the world, but these paths are never safe. Fell magic and deadly monsters are among the perils one faces when traveling in the Realms. Even farms and freeholds within a day's walk of a city can fall prey to monsters, and no place is safe from the sudden wrath of a dragon.</p>\n<p>Icewind Dale, featured in this adventure, is located in a region called the Far North, which is dominated by the Spine of the World, a range of skyscraping, snow-covered peaks. These extend toward the Sword Coast, which forms the western edge of the great continent of Faerûn and stretches southward for thousands of miles. Ships and roads lead southbound travelers to a number of bustling ports along the Sword Coast, including the following strongholds of civilization:</p>\n<ul class=\"rd__list\">\n<li class=\"rd__li \">Luskan, the City of Sails, is home to pirates as well as the Hosttower of the Arcane (headquarters of the Arcane Brotherhood, which is described in appendix C).</li>\n<li class=\"rd__li \">Neverwinter, the City of Skilled Hands, is slowly being rebuilt after it was nearly destroyed by the eruption of Mount Hotenow.</li>\n<li class=\"rd__li \">Waterdeep, the City of Splendors, is a seaside metropolis where people from all walks of life gather behind high walls.</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"878\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Adventure Flow</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></span>\n<p>The accompanying adventure flowchart visualizes the narrative flow of the adventure, which includes chapters that focus on places of interest (chapters 1 and 2) and chapters that focus on plot (chapters 3 through 7).</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://5etools-mirror-1.github.io/adventure.html#IDRotF,1\">Chapter 1</a> introduces quests that prompt the characters to explore Ten-Towns, with an additional quest waiting for them in each town they visit. These quests take no more than one or two game sessions each to complete.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://5etools-mirror-1.github.io/adventure.html#IDRotF,12\">Chapter 2</a> describes several interesting locations on the fringes of Icewind Dale, including some future threats to Ten-Towns. The characters are drawn to these locations by rumors or quests. These sites are ancillary to the main story but help bring the harsh land of Icewind Dale to life.</p>\n<p>The adventure kicks off in earnest with <a href=\"https://5etools-mirror-1.github.io/adventure.html#IDRotF,13\">chapter 3</a>, as the characters try to beard @Actor[tL8JHA0z9pJcAquS]{Xardorok Sunblight} in his lair. Chapter 3 describes the duergar's fortress. Unfortunately, the characters arrive too late to stop him from unleashing a dragon made of chardalyn. The characters face a difficult choice: continue storming Xardorok's stronghold or return to Ten-Towns to fight the dragon.</p>\n<p>The battle with Xardorok's dragon forms the crux of <a href=\"https://5etools-mirror-1.github.io/adventure.html#IDRotF,14\">chapter 4</a>. Since the dragon is a mobile threat, the characters might have to face it more than once as it ravages one settlement after another. The Ten-Towners have no hope of defeating the dragon on their own, so here's a chance for the characters to become true heroes of Icewind Dale. As they battle the dragon, the characters are aided by a necromancer named @Actor[dySXgvD0cNTqft0l]{Vellynne Harpell}, who helps steer them toward the discovery of a lost Netherese enclave entombed in the Reghed Glacier.</p>\n<p>In <a href=\"https://5etools-mirror-1.github.io/adventure.html#IDRotF,15\">chapter 5</a>, Vellynne asks the characters to accompany her to Auril's island in the Sea of Moving Ice to recover two items: an orb stolen by a rival and a book titled @Item[j8tDVg3eloi05U12]{The Codicil of White}. The orb has useful magical properties, while the book contains a magical poem that can create a passage through the Reghed Glacier.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://5etools-mirror-1.github.io/adventure.html#IDRotF,16\">Chapter 6</a> describes the Caves of Hunger, a network of ice tunnels and caves within the Reghed Glacier itself. The characters must navigate these treacherous passageways to reach the frozen Netherese city, which is described in <a href=\"https://5etools-mirror-1.github.io/adventure.html#IDRotF,17\">chapter 7</a>. The party's exploration is interrupted by an albino tiefling villain who wants all the city's magical secrets for herself.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"879\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Dissecting the Adventure</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></span>\n<p>You can dissect this adventure and use pieces of it rather than the whole thing. Nothing in this adventure is too sacred to tamper with and repurpose to serve your own needs.</p>\n<p>Most of the locations described in this book can be used as stand-alone adventure sites. With a little effort and a few name changes, you can take these adventure locations out of Icewind Dale and transplant them into other campaign worlds, including your own.</p>\n<p>Take the duergar fortress in <a href=\"https://5etools-mirror-1.github.io/adventure.html#IDRotF,13\">chapter 3</a>, for example. You could set the fortress in the Yatil Mountains of Oerth, the Ironroot Mountains of Khorvaire, the Flotket Alps of Wildemount, or some other mountain range while preserving the plot elements. You can also strip out the story about an evil duergar building a dragon construct and have the duergar doing something else instead. Alternatively, you could jettison everything but the map of the fortress, populating it with new creatures that better suit your campaign. Sometimes a good map is all a DM needs!</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"880\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Running NPC Party Members</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></span>\n<p>Nonplayer characters (NPCs) are normally controlled by the DM.

As the DM, you need to handle the horror responsibly. Although the events of the adventure should make characters feel stressed and anxious, your players should be relaxed and having fun. Before running the adventure, have a candid out-of-game conversation with your players about hard and soft limits on what topics can be broached in-game. Your players might have phobias and triggers you might not unaware of. Any topic or theme that makes a player feel unsafe should be avoided. If a topic or theme makes one or more players nervous but they give you consent to include it in-game, incorporate it with care. Be ready to move away from such topics and themes quickly, however.</p>\n<div class=\"float-clear\"> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<hr class=\"rd__hr rd__hr--section\" />\n<div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--0\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--0\" data-title-index=\"882\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Adventure Flowchart</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></span>\n<div class=\"rd__wrp-flowchart\">\n<div class=\"rd__b-special rd__b-flow\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2-flow-block\" data-title-index=\"883\"><span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Chapter 1: Ten-Towns</span></span>\n<p><em>For 1st to 4th-level characters</em></p>\n<p>Adventure quests prompt our intrepid heroes to visit the many settlements of Ten-Towns and lend a helping hand.</p>\n<div class=\"float-clear\"> </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"rd__s-v-flow\"> </div>\n<div class=\"rd__b-special rd__b-flow\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2-flow-block\" data-title-index=\"884\"><span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Chapter 2: Icewind Dale</span></span>\n<p><em>For characters of 4th level and higher</em></p>\n<p>Tall tales lead the characters to adventure locations on the fringes of Icewind Dale.</p>\n<div class=\"float-clear\"> </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"rd__s-v-flow\"> </div>\n<div class=\"rd__b-special rd__b-flow\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2-flow-block\" data-title-index=\"885\"><span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Chapter 3: Sunblight</span></span>\n<p><em>For 6th-level characters</em></p>\n<p>A duergar tyrant is building a chardalyn dragon to destroy Ten-Towns.

A character can fish on the ice instead of a boat, in which case a saw or similar tool is needed to cut a fishing hole through the ice.</p>\n<p>At the end of each hour spent fishing on the lake, the character must make a DC 15 Wisdom (<span class=\"help help--hover\" data-plut-hover=\"true\" data-plut-hover-preload=\"true\" data-plut-hover-preload-id=\"147\">Survival</span>) check. A failed check indicates no fish is caught during that hour. If the check succeeds, the character hooks a @Actor[5zSZsxjLukqYqrRa]{knucklehead trout} (see <a href=\"https://5etools-mirror-1.github.io/adventure.html#IDRotF,21\">appendix C</a>) and must make a Strength (<span class=\"help help--hover\" data-plut-hover=\"true\" data-plut-hover-preload=\"true\" data-plut-hover-preload-id=\"148\">Athletics</span>) check contested by the fish's Strength check to pull it out of the water. The trout has advantage on its check. If the character fails the check, the trout escapes. A character who fails the check by 5 or more must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or be pulled into the @hazard[frigid water] (see \"Frigid Water\" below). A character who is pulled out of the water is dripping wet and continues to suffer the effects of the frigid water until the wet clothes are taken off and replaced with dry ones.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"896\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Frigid Water</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></span>\n<p>Rules for frigid water appear in the <a href=\"https://5etools-mirror-1.github.io/book.html#DMG\">Dungeon Master's Guide</a> but are repeated here for your convenience.</p>\n<p>A creature can be immersed in frigid water for a number of minutes equal to its Constitution score before suffering any ill effects. Each additional minute spent in frigid water requires the creature to succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or gain one level of @condition[exhaustion].

But dogs are expensive and require food, water, and shelter. Unless they have more equipment than they can carry, adventurers are better off traveling on foot.</p>\n<p>The speed that characters can travel across Icewind Dale's rough, snowy tundra is given in the Overland Travel table. Travel is less time-consuming on the snowy roads and trails that connect the settlements of Ten-Towns, as discussed in <a href=\"https://5etools-mirror-1.github.io/adventure.html#IDRotF,1\">chapter 1</a>.</p>\n<table class=\"rd__table  stripe-odd-table\"><caption>Overland Travel</caption>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th class=\"col-7\" data-rd-isroller=\"false\">Method of Travel</th>\n<th class=\"col-5 text-center\" data-rd-isroller=\"false\">Distance per Hour</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"col-7\">Dogsled</td>\n<td class=\"col-5 text-center\">1 mile</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"col-7\">On foot, with snowshoes</td>\n<td class=\"col-5 text-center\">1/2 mile</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"col-7\">On foot, without snowshoes</td>\n<td class=\"col-5 text-center\">1/4 mile</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div>\n<div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"899\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Mountain Travel</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></span>\n<p>Navigating the Spine of the World or the slopes of Kelvin's Cairn is particularly arduous because of the unforgiving mountain terrain.

On a successful check, the hour's journey was not hindered by weather or terrain. On a failed check, the party comes to an impasse and must backtrack, which costs an extra hour of travel.

While the players are creating their characters, decide whether you want each party member to have a secret or not. The secrets are designed to foment mistrust among party members, creating an atmosphere of suspicion and paranoia that is appropriate for the setting.</p>\n<p>Determine each character's secret by having that character's player draw a random card from the deck. If a player doesn't like the secret they've drawn, or if the secret is a bad fit for the character, let the player discard the first draw and pick another card. Each character gets one secret to start with. Some of the secrets are benign, others not so much.</p>\n<p>If you're running the adventure for a group that loves the idea of characters who have secrets, you can allow each player to draw twice instead of once, creating a party with a disturbing number of skeletons in their closets. If you want to make it possible for more than one character to have the same secret, replace each card in the deck before the next player draws.</p>\n<p>Some players will guard their characters' secrets for the entire campaign, never sharing them. Other players will wait for the perfect occasion to reveal their characters' secrets. Don't be surprised if a player decides to reveal their character's secret right away.</p>\n<div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"907\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Using Secrets</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></span>\n<p>The following suggestions are offered to help you make the most out of the secrets in appendix B.</p>\n<div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"908\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Alagondar Scion.</span></span>\n<p>At some point, Lord Dagult Neverember might send a lone @Actor[stYsKxGZ1XDXpOll]{assassin}—a nameless, middle-aged woman with a shaved head and a hook for a right hand—to kill the character who has this secret.</p>\n<div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"> </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"909\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Doppelganger.</span></span>\n<p>This character can imitate specific NPCs and even other player characters.

The trauma of being held captive by the illithids prevents the character from remembering events prior to the crash. A @Item[KEreFhRJigIqsKBq]{greater restoration} spell removes this trauma, allowing the character to remember details about the illithids as well as the other prisoners aboard the nautiloid when it crashed (a bulette and two carrion crawlers).</p>\n<div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"> </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"913\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Littlest Yeti.</span></span>\n<p>If the party happens upon one or more yetis in the course of the adventure, this secret might reveal itself.

Iriolarthas endures as a deteriorating skull that drifts about the necropolis in lonely despair. Wispy symbols of the eight schools of magic form above it and quickly dissipate.</p><p>A demilich is what becomes of a lich that neglects to feed souls into its phylactery, and Iriolarthas's phylactery has been empty for nearly two thousand years, buried under the rubble of Ythryn far from the demilich's reach. Having lost its body and its spellcasting abilities, the demilich holds out hope that other Netherese wizards will come to its rescue, unaware that the Empire of Netheril no longer exists. Though it has been trapped in Ythryn under the ice for centuries, the demilich has a very poor sense of how much time has passed.</p><p>When confronted by new arrivals, the demilich assumes they are rescuers from another Netherese enclave and watches to see what they do. The demilich has no means of communication and can't be contacted telepathically, so it judges new arrivals in silence. Characters who observe Iriolarthas and succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom (<span class=\"help help--hover\" data-plut-hover=\"true\" data-plut-hover-preload=\"true\" data-plut-hover-preload-id=\"343\">Insight</span>) check can ascertain that the demilich is watching them closely to see how they react to their surroundings. If the demilich concludes, based on its observations, that the characters are not a rescue team from another Netherese enclave, it tries to destroy them before they can steal any of Ythryn's secrets. The same is true of invasive NPCs such as members of the Arcane Brotherhood. A party can fool the demilich into thinking they belong in Ythryn by succeeding on a DC 13 Charisma (<span class=\"help help--hover\" data-plut-hover=\"true\" data-plut-hover-preload=\"true\" data-plut-hover-preload-id=\"344\">Deception</span>) group check. If the group check is successful, Iriolarthas believes the party is what it pretends to be; on a failed group check, the demilich sees through the party's deception and becomes hostile toward the characters. If the demilich thinks that the characters are rescuers, given how they appear and act, it follows them around until something happens to change its mind.</p><p>Although it lacks the means to communicate, the demilich dimly recalls the circumstances that led to its present situation.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"2054\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">The Fall of Ythryn</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></span> <p>After using the @Item[LpiVj9Lcu3RMtOEq]{Ythryn mythallar} (see <a href=\"https://5etools-mirror-1.github.io/adventure.html#IDRotF,22,%7b%40item%20ythryn%20mythallar%7cidrotf%7d,0\">appendix D</a>) to lift the enclave of Ythryn into the sky, Iriolarthas and his apprentices traveled to the frozen north in search of relics of Ostoria, a bygone empire of magic-wielding giants that waged war against the dragons forty thousand years earlier. After many fruitless excavations, they found a large stone spindle bearing strange sigils at the bottom of the Sea of Moving Ice and brought it back to Ythryn for study in the fall of −343 DR, the Year of Chilled Marrow. During one of their experiments, something went wrong—a flash of power from the spindle caused the <i>Ythryn</i> <i>mythallar</i> to shut down, which in turn caused the city to fall out of the sky and crash into the ice below.</p><p>The inhabitants of Ythryn had only a few moments to react as the city fell. Iriolarthas conjured a doorway to a magical demiplane and stepped through it just in time. As Ythryn settled into its icy grave, all magic in the city became undone for a brief time, as though something was trying to siphon it all away. The demiplane expelled Iriolarthas in that instant, trapping the lich in Ythryn, and became a living demiplane (see <a href=\"https://5etools-mirror-1.github.io/adventure.html#IDRotF,21\">appendix C</a>). Iriolarthas searched the ruins of the city for his spellbook and his phylactery, recovering only the former. He also found several magical servants in stasis that had survived the devastation, as well as a handful of apprentices who had used their spells in ingenious ways to escape death.</p><p>Some of those inside tried to flee Ythryn, but glacial ice blocked all conventional routes of escape, and attempts to leave by magic were thwarted by a troublesome intercessor: the mysterious spindle in Iriolarthas's citadel was still putting out magical pulses of energy to hinder spellcasting. By the time this disruption stopped some fifty years later, fear and madness had warped the minds of the apprentice mages, transforming them into nothics. Meanwhile, Iriolarthas grew increasingly feeble until, finally, the lich's skeletal body turned to dust.</p><div class=\"rd__b-special rd__b-inset \"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2-inset\" data-title-index=\"2055\"><span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Fate of Netheril</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-special-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></span><p>The Empire of Netheril arose more than five thousand years ago. Those who follow the Dalereckoning calendar would place the date of Netheril's birth at −3859 DR.</p><p>The Netherese legacy began with the discovery of the <i>Nether Scrolls</i>. These long, golden scrolls taught Netherese arcanists how to wield magic beyond their wildest fantasies. It took centuries, but the Netherese who mastered the power of the <i>Nether Scrolls</i> became a ruling class, living on great flying cities or taking refuge in remote, subterranean lairs.</p><p>Despite their great power, the Netherese faced a growing threat. Under the heart of their empire lived spellcasting aberrations called phaerimm. Using their ability to drain magic, the phaerimm began to unravel the Weave, without which Netheril would collapse into ruin. In −339 DR, four years after the fall of Ythryn, the empire's most powerful arcanist, Karsus, attempted to neutralize the phaerimm threat by casting a spell of unparalleled power that would enable him to replace Mystryl as the god of magic, giving him absolute control over the Weave. Mystryl countered Karsus at a key moment during the casting of the spell, a feat she could accomplish only by sacrificing herself and tearing the Weave. Karsus was slain instantly, and for a time thereafter, most of the creatures of the world were either without magic or simply unable to control it.</p><p>Without great magic to keep them aloft, the remaining flying cities of Netheril crashed to the ground, and many arcanists who survived were driven mad. Once magic came back into use, Netherese arcanists could no longer cast their mightiest spells as they had before, forcing them to resort to traditional wizardry. Four hundred years after Karsus cast his spell, the Netherese empire was no more—crushed by its enemies and undone by its own hubris.</p><p>In the Forgotten Realms, Netheril is the definitive lost empire. It rose to unparalleled heights but eventually fell into ruin. If you've ever played a science fiction game that includes the concept of a lost, highly advanced civilization, then you can begin to imagine what ancient Netheril must have been like. Out of this empire came many of the fearsome monsters, bizarre dungeons, and wondrous magic items found in Faerûn today.</p><div class=\"float-clear\"></div></div></div></div><hr class=\"rd__hr rd__hr--section\" /><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--0\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--0\" data-title-index=\"2056\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Necropolis of Ythryn</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></span> <p>When the characters arrive at Ythryn, read:</p><div class=\"rd__b-special rd__b-inset rd__b-inset--readaloud \"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2-inset rd__h--2-inset-no-name\"><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-special-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></span><p>The tunnel opens into a vast grotto enclosed by gleaming ice.

To win, a team must eliminate the other team's players by hitting them with a 3-inch-diameter iron ball. A player struck by the thrown ball is eliminated and teleported to the sidelines. The game ends when all of one team's players have been eliminated.</p><p>When the game begins, an iron ball magically appears in a random location on the arena floor roughly equidistant from the two teams. The ball is a simple ranged weapon with the finesse and thrown properties. Its range is 120 feet, and it deals [[/r 1d4]] bludgeoning damage on a hit.</p><p>To simulate a game of Chain Lightning, follow these steps:</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"2074\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Step 1.</span></span> <p>Every player makes a Dexterity (<span class=\"help help--hover\" data-plut-hover=\"true\" data-plut-hover-preload=\"true\" data-plut-hover-preload-id=\"345\">Athletics</span>) check.

If the team on offense gets more successes than the team on defense, one player on offense can try either to hurl the ball between the metal tines of an electrified mast, hoping to impart an electrical charge to the ball, or make a ranged weapon attack with the ball against a player on defense. Each option is described below:</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div><ul class=\"rd__list\"><li class=\"rd__li \">Hurling the ball between the tines of an electrified mast requires a successful ranged attack roll against AC 15.

If the ball is electrically charged when it hits, it deals an additional 3 ([[/r 1d6]]) lightning damage to the eliminated player, and an arc of lightning shoots from the ball and automatically hits another randomly determined player on the same team. This second player takes 3 ([[/r 1d6]]) lightning damage and is also eliminated. If the ball is thrown at a player and it misses, it loses its electrical charge if it has one.

The spell can be dispelled (DC 17), which renders Xerophon visible and awake. The doppelganger looks like a thin, middle-aged man with a sallow complexion, one blue eye and one green eye, and a streak of silver in his long, jet-black hair. The awake doppelganger can use its action to try to slip free of the table's leather straps, doing so with a successful DC 20 Dexterity check, or a character can use an action to loosen the straps enough for Xerophon to get free.</p><p>Shortly before the fall of Ythryn, Xerophon murdered a Netherese sage in the city, stole his identity, and tried to infiltrate the Spire of Iriolarthas. The doppelganger was caught and imprisoned. The prison warden, a Netherese wizard, was interested in studying the doppelganger and perhaps developing a potion that emulated its shapeshifting ability. The wizard made Xerophon acquiesce to a series of experiments, and in between cast @Item[JDLYY4Qs9xjhAcye]{sequester} spells on the doppelganger as a precaution to keep it from escaping.</p><p>If questioned, Xerophon speaks Loross but switches to Common if no one in the party understands the dead Netherese tongue. The doppelganger plays the part of a low-born Netherese manservant who was sent to the prison by his master, Iriolarthas, for disobedience. Without going into much detail, Xerophon alludes to horrible magical experiments performed on prisoners by the wizard who ran the prison, saying, \"I was afraid I might be next.\"</p><p>Once it realizes the fate that has befallen Ythryn, Xerophon offers to help the characters search the rest of the city, allowing the doppelganger time to use its Read Thoughts ability to glean all the information it can from the characters' minds. After all, it has a lot of catching up to do. The doppelganger has no ill intentions toward the characters but places self-preservation above all else.</p><p>If the characters befriend Xerophon, they learn three facts from the Ythryn Lore table, which Xerophon shares to build trust. The doppelganger also knows that to bypass the force field around the Spire of Iriolarthas, one must perform the eight steps of the Rite of the Arcane Octad outside the spire. The steps of the ritual are hidden inside towers dedicated to the eight arcane schools of magic. Xerophon knows the layout of the city and can lead the party to each of these towers (areas Y4, Y7, Y11, Y18, Y20, Y22, Y24, and Y26).</p></div></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"2082\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Y6.

In the resulting chaos, the blue slaad encountered on the tower's ground floor escaped from its cell and rampaged through the observatory. The Arch-Astronomer, who became infected by the slaad's chaos phage, ordered her surviving apprentices to seal her inside the tower with the monster. In the years, decades, and centuries since, she has managed to keep the blue slaad from escaping through the hole in the roof.</p><p>The Arch-Astronomer, now a @Actor[8HmGUr0vRRwW5TKS]{green slaad}, is madly fiddling with the telescope, hoping to reverse its power so that it can project itself out of the tower to some faraway place where it can find happiness, but it has no hope of success. If the characters interrupt the Arch-Astronomer, it tries to frighten them away by baring its teeth and claws. If they touch the telescope or damage it further, the slaad goes crazy and attacks them.

Some came here determined to make their fortunes. Others come for the solitude, or to escape notice and stay out of the reach of the law of the southern cities. Today, four hundred years after the formation of Ten-Towns, most folk are here because they were born here, grew up here, and expect to die here. They're fishers, loggers, miners, hunters, trappers, furriers, and traders accustomed to the harsh climate, the slow pace, and the isolation. Like the hardy lichens and determined @Actor[CtMI2k0WmgDByvLE]{reindeer} of the tundra, residents endure and do what's needed to survive.</p><p>Icewind Dale has few trees, so lumber is cut from the slopes of the Spine of the World or the depths of the Lonelywood Forest. Stone from the hills and valleys surrounding Kelvin's Cairn supplements wood as a building material in Ten-Towns.

It started from humble beginnings four centuries ago. Immigrants from all over Faerûn came here in search of escape or adventure and built a modest trade post atop the hill where Bryn Shander now stands. One by one, settlements sprung up on the shores of Maer Dualdon, Lac Dinneshere, and Redwaters. The ever-present threat of orcs and other monsters compelled the poorly defended lakeside towns to turn Bryn Shander from a modest hilltop trading post into a walled town capable of defending all Ten-Towners if and when the worst comes.</p><p>Most of the towns contain trace evidence of the immigrant cultures that birthed them. This evidence is carved into houses, statues, and other fixtures. For example, the dinosaur carvings on the older buildings of Good Mead remind folk that many of its original settlers were Chultan.</p><p>Residents of Ten-Towns tend to remain indoors when they're not working, since it's so frightfully cold outside, which gives each settlement a deathly quiet aspect. Most people who venture outdoors are bundled up in so much cold weather clothing as to be barely recognizable, and they don't stand around long enough for the cold wind to get the better of them.</p><p>Auril's winter spell has caused the population of Ten-Towns to dwindle and has heightened rivalries that have simmered for years, turning neighboring towns against one another as competition for resources becomes increasingly intense. The alliance of Ten-Towns won't hold if the mounting tribalism continues to threaten the common good.</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"933\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Life Off the Lakes</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></span> <p>Most of the ten towns except Bryn Shander are built on the shores of three big lakes. The largest population of knucklehead trout is in Maer Dualdon, the deepest of the lakes. Redwaters, the shallowest lake, almost completely freezes in winter, making the fishing there difficult. Lac Dinneshere catches the worst of the winds blowing off the Reghed Glacier to the east and thus has the roughest waters. Small thermal vents at the bottom of these lakes keep them from freezing completely, even in the coldest winters.</p><p>Ten-Towns fishing boats are simple affairs. The smallest are rowboats and single-masted skiffs that require careful handling to avoid capsizing. Larger, twin-masted cogs and keelboats with single decks handle the wind and waves better. These ships fly the flags of their towns and provide fish for the whole community, not for any individual fisher.</p><p>When thick ice covers the lakes, many fishers stay to the shelters of their homes and hearths, but the most dedicated or desperate cut holes in the ice and dangle their lines down in hopes of tempting hungry trout.</p><div class=\"rd__b-special rd__b-inset \"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2-inset\" data-title-index=\"934\"><span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Fuel Sources</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-special-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></span><p>The folk of Ten-Towns don't have a lot of options when it comes to keeping warm. People from Good Mead, Lonelywood, and Termalaine burn wood salvaged from nearby forests to heat their houses. In the other towns of Icewind Dale, wood is too precious a commodity to burn, so whale oil is used in lamps and small stoves around which townsfolk huddle for warmth.</p><p>Ten-Towners buy their whale oil from whalers who live on the shores of the Sea of Moving Ice. Whaling is thus a lucrative (if inherently dangerous) business in Icewind Dale.</p><div class=\"float-clear\"></div></div></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"935\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Winter Survival Gear</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></span> <p>Any item listed in the equipment chapter of the <a href=\"https://5etools-mirror-1.github.io/book.html#PHB\">Player's Handbook</a> can be bought in Ten-Towns, including fishing tackle and sleds.

This is a new practice that started a little over a year ago, when it became clear that Auril was angry and summer would not be returning anytime soon. The town speakers (see the \"Council of Speakers\" sidebar) have unanimously agreed to honor these practices, which they consider necessary evils, but would end them in a heartbeat if Auril were to be appeased or dealt with in some other way.</p><p>The nature of the sacrifices varies from town to town, but usually takes one of three forms:</p><ul class=\"rd__list rd__list-hang-notitle\"><li class=\"rd__li \"><p class=\"rd__p-list-item\"><span class=\"bold rd__list-item-name\">Humanoid</span> Bryn Shander, Easthaven, and Targos hold lotteries the afternoon before the new moon.

Ferocious blizzards make the mountain pass through the Spine of the World exceedingly treacherous, and this land has not felt the warmth of the sun in over two years. In fact, the sun no longer appears above the mountains, not even in what should be the height of summer. In this frozen tundra, darkness and bitter cold reign as king and queen. Most dale residents blame Auril the Frostmaiden, the god of winter's wrath. The shimmering aurora that weaves across the sky each night is said to be her doing—a potent spell that keeps the sun at bay.</p><p>Dalefolk live in a scattering of settlements known as Ten-Towns. The drop-off in caravans coming from the south and travel between settlements in this never-ending winter has left everyone feeling isolated. Although each town has resolved to appease the Frostmaiden with sacrifices of one kind or another, no respite from winter's fury seems forthcoming. For adventurers such as yourselves, Ten-Towns is a place to test one's mettle and, in the spirit of heroes who have come before, leave one's mark on this frigid, blighted land.</p><div class=\"float-clear\"></div></div><p>Having set the stage, you can now describe the adventure's starting town using the information presented later in this chapter, and the poster map includes a map of the starting town that you can share with the players.

But today the local tavern is abuzz with news about a series of recent killings. Before the murders, the only question on everyone's mind was, \"Will summer ever return to Icewind Dale?\" Now the question is, \"Will I be the killer's next victim?\" Nothing breeds fear and paranoia like a murderer with no face.</p><p>Three cold-blooded murders have been committed in the past month: a halfling trapper in Easthaven, a human shipbuilder in Targos, and, three days ago, a dwarf glassblower in Bryn Shander. Each victim was found with a dagger of ice through the heart.</p><p>What's the connection? The drunken lot huddled in the tavern offers no credible ideas, but sitting apart from them is an elderly shield dwarf with a nasty scar across her nose who looks like she has something worth knowing. She's been smoking her pipe and eyeing you ever since you walked in.</p><div class=\"float-clear\"></div></div><p>Hlin Trollbane, a neutral good shield dwarf, is a retired bounty hunter with finely honed survival instincts. She is an unarmored @Actor[9bJz3GXNDdx5yeTY]{veteran} who wields a battleaxe and handaxe instead of a longsword and shortsword. Plying her profession earned her a few too many enemies up and down the Sword Coast, which is why she wound up in Icewind Dale.</p><p>Out of boredom and a sense of moral decency, Hlin has taken it upon herself to investigate the recent murders because no one else—not even the Council of Speakers—can be bothered. Hlin is studying the characters closely, trying to decide if they're worth her time. Ultimately, she takes the chance and draws them into conversation, asking them to help her take down her only suspect: a man named @Actor[34EQ4ldz2e7hW8Rc]{Sephek Kaltro}. Here's what she knows about Sephek and the victims:</p><div class=\"rd__b-special rd__b-inset rd__b-inset--readaloud \"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2-inset rd__h--2-inset-no-name\"><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-special-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></span><p>\"@Actor[34EQ4ldz2e7hW8Rc]{Sephek Kaltro} works for a small traveling merchant company called Torg's, owned and operated by a shady dwarf named Torrga Icevein. In other words, Sephek gets around. He's charming. Makes friends easily. He's also Torrga's bodyguard, so I'm guessing he's good with a blade.</p><p>\"His victims come from the only three towns that sacrifice people to the Frostmaiden on nights of the new moon. This is what passes for civilized behavior in Icewind Dale. Maybe the victims found a way to keep their names out of the drawings and Sephek found out they were cheating, so he killed them. Maybe, just maybe, Sephek is doing the Frostmaiden's work.</p><p>\"I followed Torg's for a tenday as it moved from town to town. Quite the devious little enterprise, but that's not my concern. What struck me is how comfortable @Actor[34EQ4ldz2e7hW8Rc]{Sephek Kaltro} looked in this weather. No coat, no scarf, no gloves. It was like the cold couldn't touch him. Kiss of the Frostmaiden, indeed.</p><p>\"I will pay you a hundred gold pieces to apprehend @Actor[34EQ4ldz2e7hW8Rc]{Sephek Kaltro}, ascertain his guilt, and deal with him, preferably without involving the authorities. When the job is done, return to me to collect your money.\"</p><div class=\"float-clear\"></div></div><p>For the benefit of characters who are new to Ten-Towns, Hlin can explain that certain settlements (Bryn Shander, Easthaven, and Targos) are making humanoid sacrifices to Auril, holding lotteries to determine who gets sacrificed on nights of the new moon (see \"Sacrifices to Auril\").</p><p>If Hlin's theory is true and @Actor[34EQ4ldz2e7hW8Rc]{Sephek Kaltro} is killing Ten-Towners who cheat their way out of becoming sacrifices to Auril, it's likely the Frostmaiden will use him to kill again. Hlin is too old and frail to apprehend Sephek herself, but she has more gold than she needs, so she hires the characters to do her work.</p><p>The challenge begins with finding @Actor[34EQ4ldz2e7hW8Rc]{Sephek Kaltro}, since Torg's moves around a lot. Hlin doesn't know if Sephek is acting alone or has the support of Torrga Icevein, so she advises the characters to isolate Sephek and dispose of him quietly, if such action is called for.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"955\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Finding Torg's</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></span> <p>You can randomly determine the location of the merchant company by rolling a [[/r d10]] and consulting the Starting Town table (see \"Starting Town\"). Roll again if the result is the adventure's starting town.

On a successful check, the character finds someone who knows Torrga Icevein's travel plans and is willing to share that information for a small bribe (at least 5 gp or nonperishable goods of equal value). Armed with that information, the characters can travel to the town by the most expeditious route.</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"956\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Torrga Icevein and Her Caravan</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></span> <p>The Torg's caravan consists of three heavily laden dogsleds, each one pulled by six friendly sled dogs. One sled carries provisions and supplies for Torrga, her team, and her dogs. It flies a flag bearing the company's emblem, a gold wolf's paw on a black field. The other two sleds transport goods for sale, including cut wood, flint and tinder, flasks of whale oil, blankets, furs, rations, bottles of wine, casks of cheap ale, fake medicines, and vials of poison (used primarily for killing vermin).</p><p>Torg's is an outdoor shop. Goods are unpacked and displayed in crates, with small canopies to keep the snow off them. Most of Torrga's goods are stolen or fenced, and she sells them for double the normal price. She has a protection racket that earns her a little coin on the side, and she also commits murders for profit on the sly. One of the larger sacks on Torrga's sled contains the frozen corpse of a male half-elf in his thirties with a stab wound in his chest. The half-elf had a bounty on his head and came to Icewind Dale to disappear. Torrga found him and killed him with Sephek's help. Once she's sold off her goods in Ten-Towns, she plans to deliver the corpse to Luskan and collect the 125 gp bounty.</p><p>Torrga is a neutral evil shield dwarf @Actor[OBYE8Jx2L39yG9o7]{bandit captain} with <span class=\"help help--hover\" data-plut-hover=\"true\" data-plut-hover-preload=\"true\" data-plut-hover-preload-id=\"151\">darkvision</span> out to a range of 60 feet, resistance to poison damage, and advantage on saving throws against being @condition[poisoned]. While Torg's is open for business, she keeps her employees close to her. She employs @Actor[34EQ4ldz2e7hW8Rc]{Sephek Kaltro} as a bodyguard and pays four others (neutral evil human @Actor[rqllHQcePIxagwZR]{bandits}) to drive and protect the other two sleds. Torrga is interested only in profits, turns a blind eye to Sephek's murderous escapades, and tries to help him as best she can without endangering her own life.</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"957\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Treasure.</span></span> <p>Torrga keeps her proceeds in a small, locked iron strongbox, which she hides in a satchel. She wears the key to the strongbox around her neck. A character with thieves' tools can use an action to try to pick the strongbox's lock, doing so with a successful DC 20 Dexterity check. The box contains 92 gp, 76 sp, 125 cp, and seven gemstones worth 10 gp each.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div></div></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"958\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Sephek Kaltro</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></span> <p>@Actor[34EQ4ldz2e7hW8Rc]{Sephek Kaltro} (see the accompanying stat block) is a well-built man in his thirties. He has an olive complexion, dark hair pulled back in a ponytail, and no facial or body hair. He is dressed in a stylish vest with matching pants and boots, similar in style to those worn by mariners of the southern Sword Coast, but wears no armor or cold weather clothing and doesn't appear to be armed. His most striking feature is his eyes, which are as blue as a frozen lake.</p><p>The best way to deal with Sephek is to confront him while he's separated from Torrga and her other cronies. Sephek stays close to Torrga during business hours. Once activity drops off, Torrga shuts down her operation for the rest of the day, puts the dogs in a kennel and the sleds in a secure shed, and pays for the team's lodgings. After Torrga retires for the night, Sephek is free to do as he pleases until the following morning. If he happens to be in Bryn Shander, Easthaven, or Targos, he stalks his next murder victim. If he's elsewhere, he spends the night drinking and carousing, then falls asleep for a few hours, preferably in an unheated place such as a barn or an abandoned cottage.</p><p>When asked about his odd style of dress, @Actor[34EQ4ldz2e7hW8Rc]{Sephek Kaltro} claims that he was born on the holiday of Midwinter and that the Frostmaiden's blessing protects him from the cold. In truth, Sephek was not born during Midwinter. He was a mariner whose ship sank off the coast of Auril's island a few months ago. He swam to the island but nearly froze to death. As his life was fading, the spirit of a frost druid beholden to Auril possessed him. The winter spirit cannibalized Sephek's spirit and is using him as a living vessel to do the Frostmaiden's work. The spirit can't leave Sephek's body; if Sephek dies, the winter spirit is destroyed along with him.</p><p>Auril inspired Sephek to travel to Ten-Towns and offer his services to Torrga Icevein. As Hlin suspects, he has been killing Ten-Towners who pay off low-ranking town officials to exclude their names from the lotteries in Bryn Shander, Easthaven, and Targos. Because he's doing the Frostmaiden's work, the spirit inside Sephek doesn't care about getting caught, and he isn't shy about admitting his guilt. He considers surrendering only because it buys time for him to escape and commit more murders. In combat, he wields a magical sword and magical daggers made of ice that he can conjure at will. These weapons melt and break like icicles in the hands of other creatures.</p><p></p><div class=\"float-clear\"></div><div><div class=\"rd__wrp-image relative\">\n\t\t\t<a href=\"https://5etools-mirror-1.github.io/img/adventure/IDRotF/010-637357081747240888.png\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" title=\"@Actor[34EQ4ldz2e7hW8Rc]{Sephek Kaltro}\">\n\t\t\t\t<img class=\"rd__image\" src=\"https://5etools-mirror-1.github.io/img/adventure/IDRotF/010-637357081747240888.png\" />\n\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t</div><div class=\"rd__image-title\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rd__image-title-inner \">@Actor[34EQ4ldz2e7hW8Rc]{Sephek Kaltro}</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</div></div><p></p></div></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"959\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Concluding the Quest</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></span> <p>After finding and slaying Sephek, the characters can return to Hlin and collect their 100 gp reward. If they don't have evidence to prove that Sephek is dead, Hlin is willing to take them at their word. If the ice-dagger murders stop, she'll know her trust was not misplaced. Failure to stop Sephek allows him to continue slaying Ten-Towners who cheat Auril the Frostmaiden. These murders occur irregularly, and only in towns visited by Torg's.</p><p>If the characters capture Sephek and deliver him to the authorities, they stop the murders but lose the reward offered by Hlin, who isn't satisfied with that outcome.</p><p>If Torrga Icevein survives but has reason to believe the characters slew her bodyguard, she pressures certain Ten-Towners not to do business with them.

Since chwingas are known to inhabit Ten-Towns and have some ability to alter their natural surroundings, Dannika thinks she can learn a lot by studying one up close. For the characters' services, Dannika is offering the group 25 gp as well as a @Item[C2ucUjYFpZKUm0Rp]{lantern of tracking (elementals)} that can help locate chwingas. She says she'll be at the local tavern each evening, so the characters should have no trouble finding her once the job is completed.

They won't come out until they no longer feel threatened by the humanoids in their presence.

The wall extends out into the lake, creating a safe harbor for the town's boats. But now Auril's long winter has frozen the water in the harbor, and many of Targos's boats are trapped in the ice. Fishers must drag their smaller vessels across the ice to get to the unfrozen lake beyond the harbor walls.</p>\n<p>Almost all the towns in Icewind Dale make their living off the lakes, but nowhere is that fact more evident than in Targos. The town has always had the biggest fishing fleet and the biggest fishing industry, and everything that goes on here revolves around hauling the knucklehead trout out of Maer Dualdon. Auril's endless winter makes the work harder, but it gets done nonetheless.</p>\n<p>Naerth Maxildanarr, a former rogue of Luskan, moved to Targos a couple of years ago, took up residence in the Luskan Arms, and spread around a lot of gold, earning the loyalty of many local fishers. His cordial, down-to-earth demeanor contributed to his swift rise to power, enabling him to replace a town speaker who was well liked but didn't want the job anymore. As the most senior representative of the Zhentarim in Ten-Towns, Naerth is determined to turn Icewind Dale into a trade hub for the Black Network. He has a dozen or more Zhentarim spies throughout Ten-Towns that he uses to good effect, disposing of suspected Harper spies and convincing business owners to buy fish from Targos instead of from other sources.</p>\n<hr class=\"rd__hr rd__hr--section\" />\n<div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--0\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--0\" data-title-index=\"1280\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Targos in a Nutshell</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></span>\n<p><strong>Friendliness</strong> ❄❄<strong>Services</strong> ❄❄❄<strong>Comfort</strong> ❄❄</p>\n<div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\">\n<div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\">\n<div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"1281\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Available Quest.</span></span>\n<p>\"Mountain Climb\".</p>\n<div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"> </div>\n<ul class=\"rd__list rd__list-hang-notitle\">\n<li class=\"rd__li \">\n<p class=\"rd__p-list-item\"><span class=\"bold rd__list-item-name\">Population</span> 1,000.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"1282\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Leaders.</span></span>\n<p>Speaker Naerth Maxildanarr (lawful evil human @Actor[SKw5uBQ0A1VhTZsR]{spy}) is secretly a Zhentarim agent, who won the speakership because of his popularity with the fishers.

As a result, much of the decor is nearly two hundred years old, reflecting Luskan as it was in the years before its decline. The inn has sturdy walls but rotten floorboards, and drafts come up into the common room from the cellar. The place is also infested with rats, which scurry between the walls at all hours of the night.

Garret's plan was to take the adventurers to Caer-Konig, the town at the foot of Kelvin's Cairn. After they acquired some climbing gear from the outfitter there, he was to lead them up the mountain. Garret took six dogs and a sled with him. Boy, here, was Garret's favorite. Raised him from a pup. Boy would never leave Garret's side unless something terrible had happened.\"</p>\n<div class=\"float-clear\"> </div>\n</div>\n<p>Keegan didn't meet the adventurers who hired Garret, so he doesn't know how many there are. At this point in the conversation, Keegan asks the characters to find his missing husband:</p>\n<div class=\"rd__b-special rd__b-inset rd__b-inset--readaloud \"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2-inset rd__h--2-inset-no-name\"><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-special-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></span>\n<p>\"It's a lot to ask, but could I persuade you to go up there and find Garret and his companions? I don't have money, but the proprietor of the Luskan Arms is a friend of mine. I could get you some free rooms at the inn. I'm also a scrimshander by trade and can give you some of my artwork. It's not worth much, I confess.\"</p>\n<div class=\"float-clear\"> </div>\n</div>\n<p>Keegan has a lot of faith in Garret's survival skills, which is why he honestly believes Garret might still be alive. If the characters accept this quest, Keegan suggests they visit Frozenfar Expeditions in Caer-Konig (see \"Frozenfar Expeditions\"), which is likely the last place anyone would have seen Garret before he went up the mountain. If the characters want to take Boy with them, Keegan won't protest.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"1292\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Journey to Kelvin's Cairn</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></span>\n<p>The characters can either travel to Caer-Konig first, then go west toward Kelvin's Cairn, or they can head straight to the mountain by cutting across the open tundra and passing through the Dwarven Valley.

Several hundred shield dwarves live in subterranean halls that connect to these mines, but they rarely venture to the surface nowadays except to forage and hunt. Characters can find refuge among the dwarves, who are civil if not friendly, but must leave within a day or two, since the dwarves have little food to spare and are too busy to entertain guests for any longer than that.

The town's squat dwellings, adorned with carvings of dinosaurs and serpents, are overshadowed by the two-story structure of the mead hall, its eaves carved and painted to resemble wyverns. As honey is the key ingredient in mead, the town literally buzzes with the droning of bees.</p><p> Every tavern in Icewind Dale is accustomed to receiving regular mead deliveries, and the town can't produce or deliver its mead fast enough. All deliveries have halted temporarily, though—because a @Actor[v1TbBuzit8kfbIjE]{verbeeg marauder} (see <a href=\"https://5etools-mirror-1.github.io/adventure.html#IDRotF,21\">appendix C</a>) emerged from the forest three days ago and stole three casks of mead that were being loaded onto a dogsled for transport to Bryn Shander. Kendrick Rielsbarrow, the town speaker and a giant of a man in his own right, stood his ground against the verbeeg and didn't fare well. After skewering Kendrick with its spear, the verbeeg grabbed the casks and disappeared whence he came. The other residents of Good Mead tried to save Kendrick, to no avail; his body lies in a local shrine. Five members of the militia went after the verbeeg but haven't returned.</p><hr class=\"rd__hr rd__hr--section\" /><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--0\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--0\" data-title-index=\"1206\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Good Mead in a Nutshell</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></span> <p><b>Friendliness</b> ❄❄<b>Services</b> ❄<b>Comfort</b> ❄❄</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"1207\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Available Quest.</span></span> <p>\"The Mead Must Flow\".</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div><ul class=\"rd__list rd__list-hang-notitle\"><li class=\"rd__li \"><p class=\"rd__p-list-item\"><span class=\"bold rd__list-item-name\">Population</span> 100.</p></li><li class=\"rd__li \"><p class=\"rd__p-list-item\"><span class=\"bold rd__list-item-name\">Leader</span> None.

It will take a week or two for the town to plan an election. One candidate is a red-bearded shield dwarf logger named Shandar Froth, and the other is Olivessa Untapoor, a middle-aged woman who descends from the town's Chultan founders and who makes casks to hold Good Mead's famous brew.</p><p> Shandar is wanted by the authorities in Mirabar for the murder of another dwarf. Zhentarim agents located Shandar a few years back and are blackmailing him into serving as their eyes and ears in town. Once a month, Shandar travels to Targos to brief Naerth Maxildanarr, its speaker, on everything that has transpired of late in Good Mead.</p><p> Olivessa doesn't want to be town speaker, but her friends are pushing her to assume the role for the good of the town.

The body is that of Speaker Kendrick Rielsbarrow, a giant of a man in his forties. He died from three stab wounds to the chest. </p><p> The shrine was built over a century ago, when the town's rivalry with Dougan's Hole raged so fiercely that the lake, a frequent battlefield, became known as Redwaters. For a time thereafter, nearly all residents of Good Mead paid homage to Tempus.

If Good Mead is the starting town for the adventure, the characters know all the information in the \"Good Mead\" section, which you can read to the players.

Both have threatened Ten-Towns in the past.</p><p>My only Harper contact in Ten-Towns is a human named Beldora, who poses as a homeless woman and spends her days gathering information in Bryn Shander.</p></div></div></div>"},"_id":"JyLkFkWpLXnvcG3R","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"ownership":{"default":0,"PP5XOkXk6hNdYKV4":3},"_stats":{"systemId":null,"systemVersion":null,"coreVersion":null,"createdTime":null,"modifiedTime":null,"lastModifiedBy":null}}

Im Winter hat das Gasthaus, wenn überhaupt, nur wenige Besucher. Die Gastwirtin mittleren Alters, Cora Mulphoon (eine neutrale, gutmütige Bürgerliche), behandelt ihre Gäste wie Könige und versucht gleichzeitig zu verbergen, dass sie kaum über die Runden kommt.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Cora's Verlust. Cora ist bestrebt, ihre Gäste zufrieden zu stellen, und entschuldigt sich bei der geringsten Provokation, wenn sie glaubt, dass die Personen mit ihrem Service nicht zufrieden sind. Sie erklärt kurz, dass ihr erwachsener Sohn und einziges Kind, Huarwar, ihr bis vor zwei Monaten bei der Hausarbeit geholfen hat. Wenn die Personen Cora um weitere Informationen bitten, sagt sie, dass ihr Sohn sich einem Suchtrupp angeschlossen hatte, um den Sprecher Shalescar zu finden, nachdem er eines Nachmittags während eines Schneesturms verschwunden war. Der Sprecher wurde wohlbehalten zurückgebracht, aber Huarwar wurde von den anderen getrennt und fand erst am nächsten Morgen den Weg nach Hause. Er hatte Erfrierungen und konnte kaum laufen.</p>\n<p>In den nächsten Tagen zeigte Huarwar eine für ihn untypische Gemeinheit gegenüber seiner Mutter. Die Veränderung in seinem Verhalten begann, nachdem Cora im Zimmer ihres Sohnes etwas gefunden hatte, das wie ein Splitter aus schwarzem Eis aussah. Huarwar schnappte ihn weg und drohte seiner Mutter mit körperlicher Gewalt, sollte sie ihn noch einmal anfassen.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Am nächsten Tag kamen zwei Tieflinge (ein Männchen und ein Weibchen) in das Gasthaus und boten Huarwar Zuflucht in ihrer Burg an. Er ging bereitwillig mit ihnen, nahm den Splitter mit und sagte seiner Mutter, dass er nie wieder zurückkehren würde. Die Tieflinge trugen Amulette, die dem Splitter in Huarwars Besitz sehr ähnlich sahen. Cora vermisst ihren Sohn furchtbar und hofft, dass er noch am Leben ist. Sie erinnert sich daran, dass einer der Tieflinge eine Burg erwähnte, und sie weiß, dass es in Zehnstädten nur zwei Burgen gibt: eine intakte in Caer-Dineval und eine verfallene in Caer-Konig. Die Charaktere könnten Huarwar im Bergfried von Caer-Dineval begegnen (siehe \"Schwarze Schwerter\").</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>"},"_id":"Wo2doWQbQUhEU42X","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"ownership":{"default":1,"PP5XOkXk6hNdYKV4":3},"_stats":{"systemId":null,"systemVersion":null,"coreVersion":null,"createdTime":null,"modifiedTime":null,"lastModifiedBy":null}}

Bremen's harbor has frozen, requiring local fishers to haul their boats across the ice to put them in the lake. Visitors who lack a boat can reach Bremen only by crossing the river, which is mostly frozen over. Targos, Termalaine, and Lonelywood are all visible from the docks on clear days.</p>\n<p>If Auril's everlasting winter has one benefit, it's that the hardy folk of Bremen are spared the seasonal floods that normally threaten the town in early summer. That's not to say that the long nights, frigid air, and howling blizzards provide any comfort. They don't.</p>\n<p>Twice in the past two months, residents of Bremen have had to mount search parties for their town speaker and oldest living resident, Dorbulgruf Shalescar, and twice they've found him wandering the frozen shores of the Shaengarne in heavy furs, with no memory of how he got there. Dorbulgruf, old even by dwarf standards, isn't long for this world. Many locals fear the same is true of the town itself, if Auril's brutal winter does not abate.</p>\n<hr class=\"rd__hr rd__hr--section\" />\n<div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--0\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--0\" data-title-index=\"967\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Bremen in a Nutshell</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></span>\n<p><strong>Friendliness</strong> ❄❄❄<strong>Services</strong> ❄<strong>Comfort</strong> ❄❄</p>\n<div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\">\n<div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\">\n<div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"968\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Available Quest.</span></span>\n<p>\"Lake Monster\".</p>\n<div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"> </div>\n<ul class=\"rd__list rd__list-hang-notitle\">\n<li class=\"rd__li \">\n<p class=\"rd__p-list-item\"><span class=\"bold rd__list-item-name\">Population</span> 150.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"969\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Leader.</span></span>\n<p>Speaker Dorbulgruf Shalescar (lawful good shield dwarf @Actor[SsRbRXUsnxODzjh5]{commoner}) speaks for the townsfolk.

She explains briefly that her adult son and only child, Huarwar, used to help with the chores until two months ago. If the characters ask Cora for more information, she says that her son had joined a search party to find Speaker Shalescar after he went missing during a blizzard one afternoon. The speaker was brought back safe and sound, but Huarwar got separated from the others and didn't find his way home until the following morning. He had frostbite and could barely walk.</p>\n<div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"> </div>\n<p>Over the next few days, Huarwar displayed a meanness toward his mother that was uncharacteristic. The change in his demeanor started after Cora found what looked like a shard of black ice in her son's room. Huarwar snatched it away and threatened his mother with bodily harm if she touched it again.</p>\n<p>The next day, two tieflings (a male and a female) arrived at the inn and offered Huarwar sanctuary in their castle. He left with them willingly, taking the shard with him and telling his mother that he would never return. The tieflings wore amulets that looked much like the shard in Huarwar's possession. Cora misses her son terribly and she hopes he is still alive. She recalls that one of the tieflings mentioned a castle, and she knows that there are only two castles in Ten-Towns: an intact one in Caer-Dineval and a ruined one in Caer-Konig. The characters might encounter Huarwar in the keep at Caer-Dineval (see \"Black Swords\").</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"976\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Five-Tavern Center</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></span>\n<p><em>Five unaffiliated taverns</em></p>\n<p>Five taverns stand in a semicircle around a central yard in the heart of Bremen.

Since none of the brothers would work for the others, each built his own tavern, and they all compete for customers.</p>\n<p>The five taverns are called Stones, Even Keel, the River's Mouth, the Grumpy Moose, and the Black-Bearded Brother.

The quest starts near the docks, where the characters come upon a shield dwarf who mistakes them for fishers looking for work. Any interaction with the dwarf is interrupted by a half-elf who claims that a monster living in Maer Dualdon has been attacking and sinking fishing boats. The half-elf is a local researcher who has collected accounts from witnesses of these attacks and concluded that it's some kind of unusual beast.</p>\n<p>Characters who search for the lake monster discover that it's an awakened @Actor[U9LfHtzIp90pTZAj]{plesiosaurus}. A @Actor[9yJkj3PhrTbeMsz6]{frost druid} (see <a href=\"https://5etools-mirror-1.github.io/adventure.html#IDRotF,21\">appendix C</a>) recently cast an @Item[bcu9EHHbJ6JfYzHo]{awaken} spell on the creature, granting it an Intelligence of 10 and the ability to communicate in the Common tongue. In return, the druid expects the plesiosaurus to attack fishing boats from Bremen, thus depriving the fishers of their livelihood and ultimately forcing the villagers to leave. The plesiosaurus feels obliged to heed the druid's wishes, for fear of losing this magical gift of sentience. Consequently, it attacks anyone from Bremen who fishes in its domain.</p>\n<div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"978\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Getting the Quest</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></span>\n<div class=\"rd__b-special rd__b-inset rd__b-inset--readaloud \"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2-inset rd__h--2-inset-no-name\"><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-special-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></span>\n<p>The lake around the creaky docks is frozen, forcing fishers to pull their rowboats up onto the ice. Standing between a pair of boats is a stout humanoid in cold weather clothing. A gray hood hides most of the humanoid's face, but you can make out a wide nose and a long, frosty beard. The stout figure stamps their feet, spots you, and waves you over.</p>\n<p>\"Good, you're here. Get to it, ingrates!

The gunwale of one of the boats has what looks like a large bite taken out of it, but both vessels are seaworthy.</p>\n<p>Grynsk has been waiting an hour for some fishers he hired the night before to arrive. In fact, those fishers have decided not to bother showing up, having weighed what Grynsk offered to pay them against the danger of the lake monster. Grynsk was drunk when he hired the fishers and doesn't remember their faces; he assumes the characters are his new employees, and he's quick about setting them to work. If the characters ignore him or walk away, he yells profanities after them but doesn't pursue them.</p>\n<p>Characters who approach Grynsk can see that his boats bear the names <em>Burly Ram</em>and <em>Pronged Goat</em>. The latter one sports the curious bite mark. Grynsk reminds the characters of what he calls \"the agreed-upon price\" of 5 cp for each trout they catch and scolds them for having already wasted precious trout-catching time.</p>\n<p>If the characters explain that they aren't his employees, Grynsk frowns and repeats that the salary he's offering is 5 cp per caught trout, and \"time is better spent anglin' than yappin'.\" He also grumbles in Dwarvish about the characters being stupid and needlessly rude.</p>\n<p>If the characters ask about the damage to the <em>Pronged Goat</em>, Grynsk gives them a dismissive wave of the hand.</p>\n<div class=\"rd__b-special rd__b-inset rd__b-inset--readaloud \"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2-inset rd__h--2-inset-no-name\"><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-special-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></span>\n<p>\"Don't you see?

If he is pressured about the validity of his story, Grynsk becomes annoyed and tells the characters to get off his docks if all they want to do is ask stupid questions.</p>\n<p>In truth, the lake monster took a bite out of the <em>Pronged Goat</em> and caused its crew to fall into the icy water, where they drowned.

Tali speaks with a soft voice and tends to go on longwinded tangents about the fauna that live in Icewind Dale.</p>\n<p>When Tali heard reports of a creature in Maer Dualdon that was attacking the Bremen fishing parties, the half-elf decided to investigate and found that boats from Bremen were the only vessels to suffer these attacks.

If the characters ask about Grynsk's damaged boat, Tali explains that it was actually found adrift, its crew presumably lost to the lake monster.</p>\n<p>Being a researcher, Tali would like to better understand the monster, which has only recently become a threat. \"Perhaps this unending winter has affected its eating habits or demeanor in some way,\" speculates the half-elf.</p>\n<div class=\"rd__b-special rd__b-inset rd__b-inset--readaloud \"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2-inset rd__h--2-inset-no-name\"><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-special-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></span>\n<p>\"Tali hands you a notebook. \"I can't offer you much other than my gratitude, but if you're going out on the lake, please write down any information you learn about the nature of this monster.

This icy land of windswept tundra recently became locked in a perpetual, dark winter without reprieve. Auril the Frostmaiden, the divine embodiment of winter's fury, has withdrawn to this cold corner of the world to live among mortals. Further, she has cast a terrible spell over Icewind Dale, to the detriment of most of its denizens.</p><p>Each night before midnight, Auril takes to the sky on the back of a white roc and weaves her spell, which manifests as a shimmering curtain of light—a beautiful aurora that illuminates the night sky and fades before dawn. This powerful magic prevents the next day's sun from rising above the horizon, turning midday into twilight and trapping Icewind Dale in winter's dark embrace, with no sunlight or warmth to melt the snow and ice. Each casting of the spell leaves the Frostmaiden weakened, with just enough divine power left to barricade the mountain pass with blizzards and churn the Sea of Moving Ice with blistering winds. Such measures discourage travelers from approaching or leaving Icewind Dale, further isolating the region. Icewind Dale has thus been trapped in a different reality from the rest of the world, for though the sun never rises over the dale, it continues to rise everywhere else.</p><p>The people of Icewind Dale know Auril's wrath when they feel it, and they have a name for the unending winter she has inflicted on them. They call it the Everlasting Rime. No one understands why the Frostmaiden has imposed her will in this way or why the other gods refuse to challenge her. This prolonged winter, which has gone on for more than two years, threatens to doom not just the flickering lights of civilization known as Ten-Towns but also the indigenous flora and fauna that need sunlight and the change of seasons to survive.</p><p>Not all creatures are discouraged by what has transpired north of the Spine of the World. The long nights and sunless days are a blessing to @creature[Xardorok Sunblight|IDRotF], a duergar who longs to carve out a domain for himself on the surface and enslave the people of Ten-Towns in the process. Already, he has taken advantage of Auril's magic and raised a fortress amid the dark shadows of the mountains. From here, his underlings strike out across the tundra in search of chardalyn—a crystalline substance known to exist only in Icewind Dale. Once he gathers enough of it, Xardorok plans to construct a chardalyn dragon and unleash it upon Ten-Towns.</p><p>Despite Auril's blizzards and other deterrents, visitors still come and go. Among the recent arrivals are four wizards of the Arcane Brotherhood, a powerful society of spellcasters based in Luskan. They've come chasing rumors of a lost city buried under the Reghed Glacier—a fragment of the long-gone Empire of Netheril, whose wizards wielded magic that terrified the gods. Netherese magic has a way of attracting power-hungry wizards, as members of the Arcane Brotherhood often are. The cities of Netheril floated among the clouds, making them almost impervious to assault for centuries. Then, nearly two thousand years ago, this floating city crashed during the fall of the empire, and no one has found or explored it since. It is, arguably, Icewind Dale's greatest secret—a necropolis of Netherese wizards and the magic they left behind. What survived the crash is anyone's guess, but we're about to find out!</p><p></p><div class=\"float-clear\"></div><div><div class=\"rd__wrp-image relative\">\n\t\t\t<a href=\"https://5etools-mirror-1.github.io/img/adventure/IDRotF/000-00-000.intro-splash.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" title=\"Two young children from Lonelywood go ice fishing on Maer Dualdon\">\n\t\t\t\t<img class=\"rd__image\" src=\"https://5etools-mirror-1.github.io/img/adventure/IDRotF/000-00-000.intro-splash.jpg\" />\n\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t</div><div class=\"rd__image-title\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rd__image-title-inner \">Two young children from Lonelywood go ice fishing on Maer Dualdon</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</div></div><p></p><hr class=\"rd__hr rd__hr--section\" /><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--0\"><h1 class=\"rd__h rd__h--0\" data-title-index=\"10\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">About This Book</span></h1> <p><i>Icewind Dale: Rime of the Frostmaiden</i> is a Dungeons &amp; Dragons adventure optimized for four to six characters.

Adventurers are much better equipped to deal with such threats, particularly in the dead of winter.</p><p>One recent arrival in the area is @creature[Xardorok Sunblight|IDRotF], a duergar warlock formerly of the Underdark. His patron, Deep Duerra, has urged Xardorok to fulfill his destiny and become the first duergar to rule a kingdom on the surface. Icewind Dale is cold, dark, and heartlessly cruel—the perfect realm for Xardorok to claim as despot. Unbeknownst to Xardorok, however, it is not Deep Duerra guiding his actions but the archdevil Asmodeus in the guise of Deep Duerra. In Xardorok, the Lord of the Nine Hells has found an eager and petty tyrant.</p><p>To achieve his goal, Xardorok is scouring the land for chardalyn, which he is forging into a dragon that he will send to destroy Ten-Towns. His sons, Durth and Nildar, lead teams of duergar on quests to retrieve more of this dark-colored crystal for their grasping, despotic father.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><h2 class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"14\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Netherese Necropolis</span></h2> <p>The wizards of bygone Netheril wielded magic that could reshape the world. They used such magic to raise their cities into the sky. The city of Ythryn was one such wonder. It crashed long ago but still exists, buried under the Reghed Glacier on the eastern edge of Icewind Dale.</p><p>This frozen necropolis holds the remnants of some of the most powerful spellcasters in the history of the Realms, including a Netherese demilich. It also contains a <i>mythallar</i> (described in <a href=\"https://5etools-mirror-1.github.io/adventure.html#IDRotF,22\">appendix D</a>), a magic item that can raise an entire city into the air and alter the weather in a fifty-mile radius.

When this tower was destroyed, the magic used to create it fused with the surrounding ice to form what is now known as chardalyn: a nonmagical, crystalline substance as strong as metal, though considerably easier to work with than steel. In the years since, more deposits of chardalyn have been found across Icewind Dale. Like the <i>Crystal Shard</i>, these deposits tend to be suffused with demonic magic. Prolonged contact with chardalyn that has become suffused with demonic magic can warp a creature's mind, causing madness that usually fades away once the contact is broken.</p><p>Chardalyn is cold to the touch and readily accepts magical enchantment, making it an ideal substance for wands, staffs, and other magic items. A chardalyn object suffused with the magic of the Upper Planes is considered a consecrated object, while a chardalyn object suffused with the magic of the Lower Planes is considered a desecrated object; both can be identified as such using a @spell[detect evil and good] spell or similar magic.</p><p>Long before Akar Kessel left his mark on Icewind Dale, Netherese wizards created their own chardalyn. Many items made from this dark-colored crystal can be found in the ruins of ancient Netherese enclaves.</p><div class=\"float-clear\"></div></div><p>Four members of the Arcane Brotherhood (a cabal of wizards who act like Wild West gunslingers) have come to Icewind Dale in search of the lost Netherese enclave, hoping to unearth its secrets. Whether the characters choose to aid or oppose these wizards is up to them, but one thing is certain: the Arcane Brotherhood won't let a band of adventurers stand between them and the magic that waits to be found in the doomed, sepulchral ruin.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><h2 class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"16\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Auril's Everlasting Rime</span></h2> <p>Auril's decision to live among mortals is explained in  <a href=\"https://5etools-mirror-1.github.io/adventure.html#IDRotF,21\">appendix C</a>. What the characters discover in the course of the adventure is that she's unhappy and craves isolation. Her nightly quest to hold the sun at bay stems from a need to preserve the beauty of things by freezing them. There is no way to reason with a being so bereft of compassion as Auril, but in her weakened state, she can be defeated or forced to reckon with her cruel indifference toward life.</p><p>Anyone who hopes to reach the Netherese city buried in the ice must first visit Auril's island and obtain @item[The Codicil of White|IDRotF], a book compiled by the Frostmaiden's most ardent followers. The tome contains a magical incantation written as a poem. This poem has the power to crack the Reghed Glacier, opening a path from the surface to the buried Netherese city of Ythryn.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><h2 class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"17\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Other Quests</span></h2> <p>Chapters 1 and 2 are structured around quests, some of which touch on the major story arcs of the adventure while others merely show off other cool aspects of the setting.</p><p>In chapter 1, the adventurers undertake quests that lead them from one Ten-Towns settlement to another.

These elements are further described below.</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><h3 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"20\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Interior Maps</span></h3> <p>Maps that appear in this book are for the DM's eyes only. As the characters explore locations on a given map, you can redraw portions of the map on graph paper, a wet-erase mat, or other surface to help your players visualize locations that might have unusual shapes or features. Your hand-drawn maps need not be faithful to the originals, and you can alter a map's features as you see fit. Nor do your maps need to be painstakingly rendered. You can omit details that are not readily visible (such as secret doors and other hidden features) until the characters are able to detect and interact with them.</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"21\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Slopes and Staircases.</span></span> <p>On all interior maps, an arrow on a slope or staircase always points in the ascending direction.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div></div></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><h3 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"22\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Poster Map</span></h3> <p>The double-sided poster map is meant to be shared with the players. One side of the poster map shows Icewind Dale, including Ten-Towns and other sites and features in the region that are common knowledge. The reverse side has player-friendly maps of the ten settlements that comprise Ten-Towns, with prominent locations called out in each town for the players' benefit.</p></div></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><h2 class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"23\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">The Forgotten Realms</span></h2> <p>The world of the Forgotten Realms is one of high fantasy, populated by elves, dwarves, halflings, humans, and other folk. In the Realms, knights dare to seek out the crypts of the fallen dwarf kings of Delzoun, looking for glory and treasure. Rogues prowl the dark alleyways of teeming cities such as Neverwinter and Baldur's Gate. Clerics wield mace and spell in the service of their gods, questing against the terrifying powers that threaten the land. Wizards plunder the ruins of the fallen Netherese empire, delving into secrets too dark for the light of day. Bards sing of kings, queens, tyrants, and heroes who died long ago.</p><p>On the roads and rivers of the Realms travel minstrels and peddlers, merchants and guards, soldiers and sailors. Steel-hearted adventurers from backcountry farmsteads and sleepy villages follow tales that take them to strange, glorious, faraway places. Good maps and clear trails can carry even an inexperienced youth with dreams of glory far across the world, but these paths are never safe. Fell magic and deadly monsters are among the perils one faces when traveling in the Realms. Even farms and freeholds within a day's walk of a city can fall prey to monsters, and no place is safe from the sudden wrath of a dragon.</p><p>Icewind Dale, featured in this adventure, is located in a region called the Far North, which is dominated by the Spine of the World, a range of skyscraping, snow-covered peaks. These extend toward the Sword Coast, which forms the western edge of the great continent of Faerûn and stretches southward for thousands of miles. Ships and roads lead southbound travelers to a number of bustling ports along the Sword Coast, including the following strongholds of civilization:</p><ul class=\"rd__list\"><li class=\"rd__li \">Luskan, the City of Sails, is home to pirates as well as the Hosttower of the Arcane (headquarters of the Arcane Brotherhood, which is described in appendix C).</li><li class=\"rd__li \">Neverwinter, the City of Skilled Hands, is slowly being rebuilt after it was nearly destroyed by the eruption of Mount Hotenow.</li><li class=\"rd__li \">Waterdeep, the City of Splendors, is a seaside metropolis where people from all walks of life gather behind high walls.</li></ul></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><h2 class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"24\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Adventure Flow</span></h2> <p>The accompanying adventure flowchart visualizes the narrative flow of the adventure, which includes chapters that focus on places of interest (chapters 1 and 2) and chapters that focus on plot (chapters 3 through 7).</p><p><a href=\"https://5etools-mirror-1.github.io/adventure.html#IDRotF,1\">Chapter 1</a> introduces quests that prompt the characters to explore Ten-Towns, with an additional quest waiting for them in each town they visit. These quests take no more than one or two game sessions each to complete.</p><p><a href=\"https://5etools-mirror-1.github.io/adventure.html#IDRotF,12\">Chapter 2</a> describes several interesting locations on the fringes of Icewind Dale, including some future threats to Ten-Towns. The characters are drawn to these locations by rumors or quests. These sites are ancillary to the main story but help bring the harsh land of Icewind Dale to life.</p><p>The adventure kicks off in earnest with <a href=\"https://5etools-mirror-1.github.io/adventure.html#IDRotF,13\">chapter 3</a>, as the characters try to beard @creature[Xardorok Sunblight|IDRotF] in his lair. Chapter 3 describes the duergar's fortress. Unfortunately, the characters arrive too late to stop him from unleashing a dragon made of chardalyn. The characters face a difficult choice: continue storming Xardorok's stronghold or return to Ten-Towns to fight the dragon.</p><p>The battle with Xardorok's dragon forms the crux of <a href=\"https://5etools-mirror-1.github.io/adventure.html#IDRotF,14\">chapter 4</a>. Since the dragon is a mobile threat, the characters might have to face it more than once as it ravages one settlement after another. The Ten-Towners have no hope of defeating the dragon on their own, so here's a chance for the characters to become true heroes of Icewind Dale. As they battle the dragon, the characters are aided by a necromancer named @creature[Vellynne Harpell|IDRotF], who helps steer them toward the discovery of a lost Netherese enclave entombed in the Reghed Glacier.</p><p>In <a href=\"https://5etools-mirror-1.github.io/adventure.html#IDRotF,15\">chapter 5</a>, Vellynne asks the characters to accompany her to Auril's island in the Sea of Moving Ice to recover two items: an orb stolen by a rival and a book titled @item[The Codicil of White|IDRotF]. The orb has useful magical properties, while the book contains a magical poem that can create a passage through the Reghed Glacier.</p><p><a href=\"https://5etools-mirror-1.github.io/adventure.html#IDRotF,16\">Chapter 6</a> describes the Caves of Hunger, a network of ice tunnels and caves within the Reghed Glacier itself. The characters must navigate these treacherous passageways to reach the frozen Netherese city, which is described in <a href=\"https://5etools-mirror-1.github.io/adventure.html#IDRotF,17\">chapter 7</a>. The party's exploration is interrupted by an albino tiefling villain who wants all the city's magical secrets for herself.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><h2 class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"25\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Dissecting the Adventure</span></h2> <p>You can dissect this adventure and use pieces of it rather than the whole thing. Nothing in this adventure is too sacred to tamper with and repurpose to serve your own needs.</p><p>Most of the locations described in this book can be used as stand-alone adventure sites. With a little effort and a few name changes, you can take these adventure locations out of Icewind Dale and transplant them into other campaign worlds, including your own.</p><p>Take the duergar fortress in <a href=\"https://5etools-mirror-1.github.io/adventure.html#IDRotF,13\">chapter 3</a>, for example. You could set the fortress in the Yatil Mountains of Oerth, the Ironroot Mountains of Khorvaire, the Flotket Alps of Wildemount, or some other mountain range while preserving the plot elements. You can also strip out the story about an evil duergar building a dragon construct and have the duergar doing something else instead. Alternatively, you could jettison everything but the map of the fortress, populating it with new creatures that better suit your campaign. Sometimes a good map is all a DM needs!</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><h2 class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"26\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Running NPC Party Members</span></h2> <p>Nonplayer characters (NPCs) are normally controlled by the DM. However, there are times in this adventure when a friendly NPC might join the party for one or more game sessions. If roleplaying that NPC becomes a burden to you, see if one of your players is willing to run the NPC as a secondary character.</p><p>If a player agrees to take control of a friendly NPC, provide that player with a copy of the NPC's stat block, along with any roleplaying notes you deem important, and warn the player that you might retake custody of the NPC at some future point. As the adventure progresses, it might become apparent that the player is unable to manage the NPC effectively, or you might need more influence over the NPC's actions and behavior. Either scenario justifies you retaking control of the NPC.</p><div class=\"rd__b-special rd__b-inset \"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2-inset\" data-title-index=\"27\"><h4 class=\"entry-title-inner\">Horror in the Far North</h4><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"> <span class=\"rd__title-link rd__title-link--inset\">p8</span><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-special-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></span><p>Parts of this adventure play out like scenes in a horror movie. As the DM, you need to handle the horror responsibly. Although the events of the adventure should make characters feel stressed and anxious, your players should be relaxed and having fun. Before running the adventure, have a candid out-of-game conversation with your players about hard and soft limits on what topics can be broached in-game. Your players might have phobias and triggers you might not unaware of. Any topic or theme that makes a player feel unsafe should be avoided. If a topic or theme makes one or more players nervous but they give you consent to include it in-game, incorporate it with care. Be ready to move away from such topics and themes quickly, however.</p><div class=\"float-clear\"></div></div></div></div><hr class=\"rd__hr rd__hr--section\" /><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--0\"><h1 class=\"rd__h rd__h--0\" data-title-index=\"28\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Adventure Flowchart</span></h1> <div class=\"rd__wrp-flowchart\"><div class=\"rd__b-special rd__b-flow\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2-flow-block\" data-title-index=\"29\"><h4 class=\"entry-title-inner\">Chapter 1: Ten-Towns</h4></span><p><i>For 1st to 4th-level characters</i></p><p>Adventure quests prompt our intrepid heroes to visit the many settlements of Ten-Towns and lend a helping hand.</p><div class=\"float-clear\"></div></div><div class=\"rd__s-v-flow\"></div><div class=\"rd__b-special rd__b-flow\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2-flow-block\" data-title-index=\"30\"><h4 class=\"entry-title-inner\">Chapter 2: Icewind Dale</h4></span><p><i>For characters of 4th level and higher</i></p><p>Tall tales lead the characters to adventure locations on the fringes of Icewind Dale.</p><div class=\"float-clear\"></div></div><div class=\"rd__s-v-flow\"></div><div class=\"rd__b-special rd__b-flow\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2-flow-block\" data-title-index=\"31\"><h4 class=\"entry-title-inner\">Chapter 3: Sunblight</h4></span><p><i>For 6th-level characters</i></p><p>A duergar tyrant is building a chardalyn dragon to destroy Ten-Towns.

class=\"entry-title-inner\">Character Creation</span></h1> <p>Before starting the adventure, consider spending your first game session helping your players create characters. Were the characters born and raised in Icewind Dale, or do they hail from distant lands? How long have they known each other? What secrets are they hiding? The following sections can help you answer these questions.</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><h2 class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"48\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Character Backgrounds</span></h2> <p>The <a href=\"https://5etools-mirror-1.github.io/book.html#PHB\">Player's Handbook</a> contains character backgrounds that are well suited for this adventure. If your players are having trouble fleshing out their characters' backgrounds with details about Icewind Dale, share the suggestions from the Character Hooks Tied to Backgrounds table with them.</p><table class=\"w-100 rd__table  stripe-odd-table\"><caption>Character Hooks Tied to Backgrounds</caption><thead><tr><th class=\"col-1\" data-rd-isroller=\"false\">Background</th><th class=\"col-11\" data-rd-isroller=\"false\">Character Hook</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class=\"col-1\">Acolyte</td><td class=\"col-11\">Auril the Frostmaiden, the god of winter's fury, has cast an evil spell over Icewind Dale. You can bring hope and faith to the people of Ten-Towns or, even better, free them from winter's cold embrace in the name of your god.</td></tr><tr><td class=\"col-1\">Charlatan</td><td class=\"col-11\">Your cons and deceptions nearly got the better of you. You needed to disappear for a while, and Icewind Dale was the perfect place to do so. Nothing could prepare you for the cold and the dark desolation, but at least there's money to be made.</td></tr><tr><td class=\"col-1\">Criminal</td><td class=\"col-11\">You are wanted for crimes in the cities of Luskan and Mirabar, but no one will think to look for you in Ten-Towns, the cold heart of Icewind Dale. Thankfully, nobody in Ten-Towns cares who you are—or what you've done.</td></tr><tr><td class=\"col-1\">Entertainer</td><td class=\"col-11\">You came to Icewind Dale three years ago seeking inspiration for a new song or poem, drawn by tales of the land's harsh beauty and the legendary exploits of Drizzt Do'Urden. Since then, Auril the Frostmaiden has cast an evil spell over the dale, preventing you from returning home.</td></tr><tr><td class=\"col-1\">Folk Hero</td><td class=\"col-11\">Your name is synonymous with heroism throughout Ten-Towns. Did you save a fisher who fell into the ice, scare away a yeti armed with only a fishing pole and a basket, or beat a drunk goliath at arm wrestling?</td></tr><tr><td class=\"col-1\">Guild Artisan</td><td class=\"col-11\">You came to Icewind Dale to start a business. Your shop was doing well until Auril the Frostmaiden cast her evil spell to banish the sun. Now, businesses throughout Ten-Towns are suffering, yours included. To avoid hardship, you might need to supplement your income.</td></tr><tr><td class=\"col-1\">Hermit</td><td class=\"col-11\">You've never felt at ease in civilized society, and there's no place farther from the trappings of civilization than Icewind Dale. This is a land without pretense, and the people of Ten-Towns pay you little mind. To them, you're just another silly old fool.</td></tr><tr><td class=\"col-1\">Noble</td><td class=\"col-11\">Your wealthy grandfather or grandmother sent you to Icewind Dale to learn a hard lesson. Perhaps the cruel indifference of this frozen land will prepare you for the cruel indifference of Waterdeep's politics.</td></tr><tr><td class=\"col-1\">Outlander</td><td class=\"col-11\">You're a child of the icy wilderness, born and raised in one of the Reghed tribes. Imagine, after following herds of migrating @creature[reindeer|IDRotF] your whole life, getting a taste of what life in Ten-Towns has to offer.</td></tr><tr><td class=\"col-1\">Sage</td><td class=\"col-11\">You came to Icewind Dale in search of ruins and artifacts left behind by the giants who ruled the ancient empire of Ostoria. To find even one Ostorian relic would fulfill a lifelong dream and make your rivals back home green with envy.</td></tr><tr><td class=\"col-1\">Sailor</td><td class=\"col-11\">You've sailed ships up and down the Sword Coast, but a shipwreck made you reevaluate your life choices. Two years ago, you headed north, bought a house and a fishing boat in Ten-Towns, and became a fisher. You were told that the summers here are beautiful, but you have yet to see one.</td></tr><tr><td class=\"col-1\">Soldier</td><td class=\"col-11\">You are a soldier of Ten-Towns, trained to fight orcs and other threats lurking in the Spine of the World mountains. Auril the Frostmaiden has cast an evil spell over Icewind Dale, and you struggle to see how your soldier's training can save this land from so terrible a doom. Still, you are not about to give up on the people of Ten-Towns.</td></tr><tr><td class=\"col-1\">Urchin</td><td class=\"col-11\">Because you grew up in Ten-Towns, your familiarity with the residents makes you useful to Harper spies and Zhentarim bounty hunters who are looking for criminals and other ne'er-do-wells hiding in your midst. Ratting out these newcomers keeps coin in your pockets.</td></tr></tbody></table></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><h2 class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"49\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Goliath Player Characters</span></h2> <p>All the character races presented in the <a href=\"https://5etools-mirror-1.github.io/book.html#PHB\">Player's Handbook</a> are well suited for this adventure, as are goliaths—tall, strong folk who live in the mountains. Appendix C includes a description of goliaths and their traits, if you want to allow them in your game.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><h2 class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"50\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Starting Equipment</span></h2> <p>All characters begin the adventure with a free set of cold weather clothing in addition to the starting equipment they receive from their class and background choices.

While the players are creating their characters, decide whether you want each party member to have a secret or not. The secrets are designed to foment mistrust among party members, creating an atmosphere of suspicion and paranoia that is appropriate for the setting.</p><p>Determine each character's secret by having that character's player draw a random card from the deck. If a player doesn't like the secret they've drawn, or if the secret is a bad fit for the character, let the player discard the first draw and pick another card. Each character gets one secret to start with. Some of the secrets are benign, others not so much.</p><p>If you're running the adventure for a group that loves the idea of characters who have secrets, you can allow each player to draw twice instead of once, creating a party with a disturbing number of skeletons in their closets. If you want to make it possible for more than one character to have the same secret, replace each card in the deck before the next player draws.</p><p>Some players will guard their characters' secrets for the entire campaign, never sharing them. Other players will wait for the perfect occasion to reveal their characters' secrets. Don't be surprised if a player decides to reveal their character's secret right away.</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><h3 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"53\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Using Secrets</span></h3> <p>The following suggestions are offered to help you make the most out of the secrets in appendix B.</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"54\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Alagondar Scion.</span></span> <p>At some point, Lord Dagult Neverember might send a lone @creature[assassin]—a nameless, middle-aged woman with a shaved head and a hook for a right hand—to kill the character who has this secret.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"55\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Doppelganger.</span></span> <p>This character can imitate specific NPCs and even other player characters. If this character's secret becomes widely known, the people of Ten-Towns will almost certainly try to kill or drive away the character out of fear.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"56\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Drizzt Fan.</span></span> <p>This harmless secret comes with no strings attached and is a nod to R.A. Salvatore's Drizzt novels, which were among the first works to bring Icewind Dale to life.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"57\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Elusive Paramour.</span></span> <p>This secret is another nod to the Drizzt novels, setting up a situation like the one faced by Regis the halfling. At a time of your choosing, you can have the disgruntled pasha's assassin, an @creature[invisible stalker], show up to menace the character.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"58\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Escaped Prisoner.</span></span> <p>The character with this secret knows the location of the crashed nautiloid in chapter 2 and can lead the party to it. The trauma of being held captive by the illithids prevents the character from remembering events prior to the crash. A @spell[greater restoration] spell removes this trauma, allowing the character to remember details about the illithids as well as the other prisoners aboard the nautiloid when it crashed (a bulette and two carrion crawlers).</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"59\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Littlest Yeti.</span></span> <p>If the party happens upon one or more yetis in the course of the adventure, this secret might reveal itself. You can also rule that yeti tykes (see <a href=\"https://5etools-mirror-1.github.io/adventure.html#IDRotF,21\">appendix C</a>) are friendly toward this character by default.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"60\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Midwinter Child.</span></span> <p>This is one of the more useful secrets, since the character possessing it is immune to the effects of extreme cold. Also, the player might decide that their character is sympathetic toward Auril because of the gift she has bestowed. If the party succeeds in killing Auril, the benefits of this secret are lost.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"61\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Old Flame.</span></span> <p>This secret comes to light when the player chooses the character's secret lover. Since the onus falls on the player to choose this NPC, the lover can change each time you run this adventure with a different group of characters. This secret can also be used to turn an NPC foe into a potential ally, at your discretion.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"62\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Orc Stone.</span></span> <p>The spirit summoned by the stone belongs to a fierce @creature[orc war chief] named Vokarr the Eyebiter, who was killed by dwarves. This spirit looks like a living, breathing orc. It speaks Common and Orc.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"63\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Owlbear Whisperer.</span></span> <p>If the character uses this secret to change an owlbear's attitude to friendly, the owlbear can become the character's companion and protector, and you can run the owlbear as an NPC.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"64\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Pirate Cannibal.</span></span> <p>The character with this secret knows the location of the Dark Duchess in chapter 2 and can lead the party to it. The character would also know the ship's layout.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"65\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Reghed Heir.</span></span> <p>More information about Queen @creature[Bjornhild Solvigsdottir|IDRotF] and the Tiger Tribe can be found in appendix C. Bjornhild would hardly recognize her discarded offspring, but any character who presents themselves as such will be attacked at once. Bjornhild has no love for her would-be heir, seeing that character only as a rival and a sacrifice to Auril.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"66\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Reincarnation.</span></span> <p>Allow the player to flesh out the details of the character's life prior to being reincarnated, and try to imagine how that back story might tie into some part of the adventure. Some of the races listed in the @spell[reincarnate] spell's table go by different names in the Realms, as noted in the Forgotten Realms Races table.

Some came here determined to make their fortunes. Others come for the solitude, or to escape notice and stay out of the reach of the law of the southern cities. Today, four hundred years after the formation of Ten-Towns, most folk are here because they were born here, grew up here, and expect to die here. They're fishers, loggers, miners, hunters, trappers, furriers, and traders accustomed to the harsh climate, the slow pace, and the isolation. Like the hardy lichens and determined @creature[reindeer|IDRotF] of the tundra, residents endure and do what's needed to survive.</p><p>Icewind Dale has few trees, so lumber is cut from the slopes of the Spine of the World or the depths of the Lonelywood Forest. Stone from the hills and valleys surrounding Kelvin's Cairn supplements wood as a building material in Ten-Towns. Homes have sharply pitched roofs to prevent snow from accumulating on them.</p><p>The people of Ten-Towns wear layers of woolen clothing often topped off with fur cloaks. Under these heavy clothes and cloaks, one resident looks very much the same as another. Outdoors, it's hard to tell the people of Ten-Towns apart—and easy for clever monsters to hide in their midst.</p><p></p><div class=\"float-clear\"></div><div><div class=\"rd__wrp-image relative\">\n\t\t\t<a href=\"https://5etools-mirror-1.github.io/img/adventure/IDRotF/006-01-000.chapter-splash.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" title=\"The Easthaven ferry is trapped in ice, just like the rest of Ten-Towns..\">\n\t\t\t\t<img class=\"rd__image\" src=\"https://5etools-mirror-1.github.io/img/adventure/IDRotF/006-01-000.chapter-splash.jpg\" />\n\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t</div><div class=\"rd__image-title\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rd__image-title-inner \">The Easthaven ferry is trapped in ice, just like the rest of Ten-Towns..</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</div></div><p></p><hr class=\"rd__hr rd__hr--section\" /><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--0\"><h1 class=\"rd__h rd__h--0\" data-title-index=\"72\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Running This Chapter</span></h1> <p>Getting off on the right foot is important.

It started from humble beginnings four centuries ago. Immigrants from all over Faerûn came here in search of escape or adventure and built a modest trade post atop the hill where Bryn Shander now stands. One by one, settlements sprung up on the shores of Maer Dualdon, Lac Dinneshere, and Redwaters. The ever-present threat of orcs and other monsters compelled the poorly defended lakeside towns to turn Bryn Shander from a modest hilltop trading post into a walled town capable of defending all Ten-Towners if and when the worst comes.</p><p>Most of the towns contain trace evidence of the immigrant cultures that birthed them. This evidence is carved into houses, statues, and other fixtures. For example, the dinosaur carvings on the older buildings of Good Mead remind folk that many of its original settlers were Chultan.</p><p>Residents of Ten-Towns tend to remain indoors when they're not working, since it's so frightfully cold outside, which gives each settlement a deathly quiet aspect. Most people who venture outdoors are bundled up in so much cold weather clothing as to be barely recognizable, and they don't stand around long enough for the cold wind to get the better of them.</p><p>Auril's winter spell has caused the population of Ten-Towns to dwindle and has heightened rivalries that have simmered for years, turning neighboring towns against one another as competition for resources becomes increasingly intense. The alliance of Ten-Towns won't hold if the mounting tribalism continues to threaten the common good.</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><h2 class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"79\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Life Off the Lakes</span></h2> <p>Most of the ten towns except Bryn Shander are built on the shores of three big lakes. The largest population of knucklehead trout is in Maer Dualdon, the deepest of the lakes. Redwaters, the shallowest lake, almost completely freezes in winter, making the fishing there difficult. Lac Dinneshere catches the worst of the winds blowing off the Reghed Glacier to the east and thus has the roughest waters. Small thermal vents at the bottom of these lakes keep them from freezing completely, even in the coldest winters.</p><p>Ten-Towns fishing boats are simple affairs. The smallest are rowboats and single-masted skiffs that require careful handling to avoid capsizing. Larger, twin-masted cogs and keelboats with single decks handle the wind and waves better. These ships fly the flags of their towns and provide fish for the whole community, not for any individual fisher.</p><p>When thick ice covers the lakes, many fishers stay to the shelters of their homes and hearths, but the most dedicated or desperate cut holes in the ice and dangle their lines down in hopes of tempting hungry trout.</p><div class=\"rd__b-special rd__b-inset \"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2-inset\" data-title-index=\"80\"><h4 class=\"entry-title-inner\">Fuel Sources</h4><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"> <span class=\"rd__title-link rd__title-link--inset\">p19</span><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-special-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></span><p>The folk of Ten-Towns don't have a lot of options when it comes to keeping warm. People from Good Mead, Lonelywood, and Termalaine burn wood salvaged from nearby forests to heat their houses.

This is a new practice that started a little over a year ago, when it became clear that Auril was angry and summer would not be returning anytime soon. The town speakers (see the \"Council of Speakers\" sidebar) have unanimously agreed to honor these practices, which they consider necessary evils, but would end them in a heartbeat if Auril were to be appeased or dealt with in some other way.</p><p>The nature of the sacrifices varies from town to town, but usually takes one of three forms:</p><ul class=\"rd__list rd__list-hang-notitle\"><li class=\"rd__li \"><p class=\"rd__p-list-item\"><span class=\"bold rd__list-item-name\">Humanoid.</span> Bryn Shander, Easthaven, and Targos hold lotteries the afternoon before the new moon.

Ferocious blizzards make the mountain pass through the Spine of the World exceedingly treacherous, and this land has not felt the warmth of the sun in over two years. In fact, the sun no longer appears above the mountains, not even in what should be the height of summer. In this frozen tundra, darkness and bitter cold reign as king and queen. Most dale residents blame Auril the Frostmaiden, the god of winter's wrath. The shimmering aurora that weaves across the sky each night is said to be her doing—a potent spell that keeps the sun at bay.</p><p>Dalefolk live in a scattering of settlements known as Ten-Towns. The drop-off in caravans coming from the south and travel between settlements in this never-ending winter has left everyone feeling isolated. Although each town has resolved to appease the Frostmaiden with sacrifices of one kind or another, no respite from winter's fury seems forthcoming.

Hlin hires the characters to apprehend her suspect and dole out some cold, swift justice by quietly disposing of him if they believe he's guilty.

But today the local tavern is abuzz with news about a series of recent killings. Before the murders, the only question on everyone's mind was, \"Will summer ever return to Icewind Dale?\" Now the question is, \"Will I be the killer's next victim?\" Nothing breeds fear and paranoia like a murderer with no face.</p><p>Three cold-blooded murders have been committed in the past month: a halfling trapper in Easthaven, a human shipbuilder in Targos, and, three days ago, a dwarf glassblower in Bryn Shander. Each victim was found with a dagger of ice through the heart.</p><p>What's the connection? The drunken lot huddled in the tavern offers no credible ideas, but sitting apart from them is an elderly shield dwarf with a nasty scar across her nose who looks like she has something worth knowing. She's been smoking her pipe and eyeing you ever since you walked in.</p><div class=\"float-clear\"></div></div><p>Hlin Trollbane, a neutral good shield dwarf, is a retired bounty hunter with finely honed survival instincts. She is an unarmored @creature[veteran] who wields a battleaxe and handaxe instead of a longsword and shortsword. Plying her profession earned her a few too many enemies up and down the Sword Coast, which is why she wound up in Icewind Dale.</p><p>Out of boredom and a sense of moral decency, Hlin has taken it upon herself to investigate the recent murders because no one else—not even the Council of Speakers—can be bothered. Hlin is studying the characters closely, trying to decide if they're worth her time. Ultimately, she takes the chance and draws them into conversation, asking them to help her take down her only suspect: a man named @creature[Sephek Kaltro|IDRotF]. Here's what she knows about Sephek and the victims:</p><div class=\"rd__b-special rd__b-inset rd__b-inset--readaloud \"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2-inset rd__h--2-inset-no-name\"><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-special-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></span><p>\"@creature[Sephek Kaltro|IDRotF] works for a small traveling merchant company called Torg's, owned and operated by a shady dwarf named Torrga Icevein. In other words, Sephek gets around. He's charming. Makes friends easily. He's also Torrga's bodyguard, so I'm guessing he's good with a blade.</p><p>\"His victims come from the only three towns that sacrifice people to the Frostmaiden on nights of the new moon. This is what passes for civilized behavior in Icewind Dale. Maybe the victims found a way to keep their names out of the drawings and Sephek found out they were cheating, so he killed them. Maybe, just maybe, Sephek is doing the Frostmaiden's work.</p><p>\"I followed Torg's for a tenday as it moved from town to town. Quite the devious little enterprise, but that's not my concern. What struck me is how comfortable @creature[Sephek Kaltro|IDRotF] looked in this weather. No coat, no scarf, no gloves. It was like the cold couldn't touch him. Kiss of the Frostmaiden, indeed.</p><p>\"I will pay you a hundred gold pieces to apprehend @creature[Sephek Kaltro|IDRotF], ascertain his guilt, and deal with him, preferably without involving the authorities. When the job is done, return to me to collect your money.\"</p><div class=\"float-clear\"></div></div><p>For the benefit of characters who are new to Ten-Towns, Hlin can explain that certain settlements (Bryn Shander, Easthaven, and Targos) are making humanoid sacrifices to Auril, holding lotteries to determine who gets sacrificed on nights of the new moon (see \"Sacrifices to Auril\").</p><p>If Hlin's theory is true and @creature[Sephek Kaltro|IDRotF] is killing Ten-Towners who cheat their way out of becoming sacrifices to Auril, it's likely the Frostmaiden will use him to kill again. Hlin is too old and frail to apprehend Sephek herself, but she has more gold than she needs, so she hires the characters to do her work.</p><p>The challenge begins with finding @creature[Sephek Kaltro|IDRotF], since Torg's moves around a lot. Hlin doesn't know if Sephek is acting alone or has the support of Torrga Icevein, so she advises the characters to isolate Sephek and dispose of him quietly, if such action is called for.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><h2 class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"101\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Finding Torg's</span></h2> <p>You can randomly determine the location of the merchant company by rolling a [[/r d10]] and consulting the Starting Town table (see \"Starting Town\").

Any character who spends an hour talking to townsfolk can make a DC 17 Charisma (@skill[Investigation]) check at the end of that hour. On a successful check, the character finds someone who knows Torrga Icevein's travel plans and is willing to share that information for a small bribe (at least 5 gp or nonperishable goods of equal value). Armed with that information, the characters can travel to the town by the most expeditious route.</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><h3 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"102\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Torrga Icevein and Her Caravan</span></h3> <p>The Torg's caravan consists of three heavily laden dogsleds, each one pulled by six friendly sled dogs. One sled carries provisions and supplies for Torrga, her team, and her dogs. It flies a flag bearing the company's emblem, a gold wolf's paw on a black field. The other two sleds transport goods for sale, including cut wood, flint and tinder, flasks of whale oil, blankets, furs, rations, bottles of wine, casks of cheap ale, fake medicines, and vials of poison (used primarily for killing vermin).</p><p>Torg's is an outdoor shop. Goods are unpacked and displayed in crates, with small canopies to keep the snow off them. Most of Torrga's goods are stolen or fenced, and she sells them for double the normal price. She has a protection racket that earns her a little coin on the side, and she also commits murders for profit on the sly. One of the larger sacks on Torrga's sled contains the frozen corpse of a male half-elf in his thirties with a stab wound in his chest. The half-elf had a bounty on his head and came to Icewind Dale to disappear. Torrga found him and killed him with Sephek's help. Once she's sold off her goods in Ten-Towns, she plans to deliver the corpse to Luskan and collect the 125 gp bounty.</p><p>Torrga is a neutral evil shield dwarf @creature[bandit captain] with @sense[darkvision] out to a range of 60 feet, resistance to poison damage, and advantage on saving throws against being @condition[poisoned]. While Torg's is open for business, she keeps her employees close to her. She employs @creature[Sephek Kaltro|IDRotF] as a bodyguard and pays four others (neutral evil human @creature[Bandit||bandits]) to drive and protect the other two sleds. Torrga is interested only in profits, turns a blind eye to Sephek's murderous escapades, and tries to help him as best she can without endangering her own life.</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"103\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Treasure.</span></span> <p>Torrga keeps her proceeds in a small, locked iron strongbox, which she hides in a satchel. She wears the key to the strongbox around her neck. A character with thieves' tools can use an action to try to pick the strongbox's lock, doing so with a successful DC 20 Dexterity check. The box contains 92 gp, 76 sp, 125 cp, and seven gemstones worth 10 gp each.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div></div></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><h3 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"104\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Sephek Kaltro</span></h3> <p>@creature[Sephek Kaltro|IDRotF] (see the accompanying stat block) is a well-built man in his thirties. He has an olive complexion, dark hair pulled back in a ponytail, and no facial or body hair. He is dressed in a stylish vest with matching pants and boots, similar in style to those worn by mariners of the southern Sword Coast, but wears no armor or cold weather clothing and doesn't appear to be armed. His most striking feature is his eyes, which are as blue as a frozen lake.</p><p>The best way to deal with Sephek is to confront him while he's separated from Torrga and her other cronies. Sephek stays close to Torrga during business hours. Once activity drops off, Torrga shuts down her operation for the rest of the day, puts the dogs in a kennel and the sleds in a secure shed, and pays for the team's lodgings. After Torrga retires for the night, Sephek is free to do as he pleases until the following morning. If he happens to be in Bryn Shander, Easthaven, or Targos, he stalks his next murder victim. If he's elsewhere, he spends the night drinking and carousing, then falls asleep for a few hours, preferably in an unheated place such as a barn or an abandoned cottage.</p><p>When asked about his odd style of dress, @creature[Sephek Kaltro|IDRotF] claims that he was born on the holiday of Midwinter and that the Frostmaiden's blessing protects him from the cold. In truth, Sephek was not born during Midwinter. He was a mariner whose ship sank off the coast of Auril's island a few months ago. He swam to the island but nearly froze to death. As his life was fading, the spirit of a frost druid beholden to Auril possessed him. The winter spirit cannibalized Sephek's spirit and is using him as a living vessel to do the Frostmaiden's work. The spirit can't leave Sephek's body; if Sephek dies, the winter spirit is destroyed along with him.</p><p>Auril inspired Sephek to travel to Ten-Towns and offer his services to Torrga Icevein. As Hlin suspects, he has been killing Ten-Towners who pay off low-ranking town officials to exclude their names from the lotteries in Bryn Shander, Easthaven, and Targos. Because he's doing the Frostmaiden's work, the spirit inside Sephek doesn't care about getting caught, and he isn't shy about admitting his guilt.

It prompts the characters to explore the various locales in Ten-Towns, where they can pick up other quests.</p><p>At the start of this quest, the characters are approached by a young spellcaster named Dannika Graysteel. A new resident of Ten-Towns, she's trying to find a way to alter the climate in Icewind Dale. She hires them to locate and capture a @creature[chwinga|IDRotF], several of which she believes are located in and around Ten-Towns. Although she provides the characters with a magical means to locate chwingas, it's up to them to figure out a way to capture one or convince it to help Dannika with her experiments.</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><h2 class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"107\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Getting the Quest</span></h2> <p>Begin this quest by reading the following boxed text to the players:</p><div class=\"rd__b-special rd__b-inset rd__b-inset--readaloud \"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2-inset rd__h--2-inset-no-name\"><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-special-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></span><p>A bundled-up figure walks briskly up to you. \"Well met!

You wouldn't be standing around in this cold otherwise.\"</p><div class=\"float-clear\"></div></div><p>The speaker is Dannika Graysteel (lawful neutral half-elf @creature[acolyte]), a scholar who thinks that wee elemental spirits known as chwingas might be the key to improving Icewind Dale's climate. Since chwingas are known to inhabit Ten-Towns and have some ability to alter their natural surroundings, Dannika thinks she can learn a lot by studying one up close. For the characters' services, Dannika is offering the group 25 gp as well as a @item[Lantern of Tracking|IDRotF|lantern of tracking (elementals)] that can help locate chwingas. She says she'll be at the local tavern each evening, so the characters should have no trouble finding her once the job is completed. If the characters accept her quest, Dannika gives them her lantern (see <a href=\"https://5etools-mirror-1.github.io/adventure.html#IDRotF,22\">appendix D</a>) and explains how it works. She then tells them she's been looking all over town and hasn't found any chwingas. She suggests the characters might have better luck in one of the other settlements. She could continue the search herself, but she's nervous about venturing out into the extreme cold and has other research-related chores to attend to.</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><h3 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"108\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Elusive Elementals</span></h3> <p>There are no chwingas in the adventurers' starting town, but each time they visit another town in Icewind Dale, there's a cumulative [[/r 1d100]] (25 percent) chance of chwingas being present. Searching a town for chwingas doesn't take long if the characters use the @item[lantern of tracking|IDRotF], since the towns are small and compact.</p><p>If the characters ask the residents of a town about @creature[chwinga|IDRotF] sightings, people seem dismissive of the notion of elementals living among them. The occasional fisher reeking of dwarven ale might recall seeing \"a tiny figure riding a fox through town\" but can't remember where or when the sighting occurred.</p></div></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><h2 class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"109\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Thieves in the Wind</span></h2> <p>When the characters find a town that has chwingas living in or near it, the flame in the @item[Lantern of Tracking|IDRotF|lantern of tracking (elementals)] turns green as they approach the edge of town, whereupon they spot a bundled-up figure—a human commoner named Elva—stomping out of a snow-covered cottage. Upon seeing the adventurers, she starts yelling at the wind and warning the characters to watch out for the curses it brings. According to Elva, trickster spirits have been opening her windows, sending horrible chills through her home, and knocking over her cups and plates. Some of her cutlery has even gone missing.</p><p>Characters who inspect the windows of Elva's cottage can make a DC 10 Intelligence (@skill[Investigation]) check. On a success, they find wee tracks leading away from a snowy windowsill of the cottage toward a nearby thicket. A character who succeeds on a DC 14 Wisdom (@skill[Survival]) check can discern three individual sets of tiny footprints. Some of the footprints have a thin furrow in the snow alongside them, as if something was being dragged behind the creatures.</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><h3 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"110\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Playing House</span></h3> <p>By following the tracks, a character with a passive Wisdom (@skill[Perception]) score of 13 or higher can pick up the sound of movement from behind the conifers, where three @creature[Chwinga|ToA|chwingas] (see <a href=\"https://5etools-mirror-1.github.io/adventure.html#IDRotF,21\">appendix C</a>) are playing atop the snow in a clearing. A dinner plate with branches and pinecones arrayed on it is placed between them, and one @creature[chwinga|IDRotF] is sitting at the edge of the plate while the two others are moving a fork and a knife as if to cut and eat the \"food.\"</p><p>When the characters enter the clearing, the chwingas look up at them with interest. The one not holding a piece of cutlery starts moving its hands, mimicking eating while looking up at the characters and making welcoming gestures.</p><p>If a character indulges in the game of pretend that is being played out, such as by sitting down and joining the dinner, the chwingas become excited and start inspecting the character in detail. After this, the @creature[chwinga|IDRotF] that wasn't holding any cutlery begins following the character, remaining with that individual for up to a tenday, leaving the other chwingas behind. When the @creature[chwinga|IDRotF] finally parts company with the character, assuming it has been well treated, it bestows a supernatural charm upon the character (see \"<a href=\"https://5etools-mirror-1.github.io/book.html#DMG,7,supernatural%20gifts,0\">Supernatural Gifts</a>\" in the <a href=\"https://5etools-mirror-1.github.io/book.html#DMG\">Dungeon Master's Guide</a> for more information). The charm can be any one of the following:</p><ul class=\"rd__list\"><li class=\"rd__li \">A @reward[charm of animal conjuring], a @reward[charm of heroism], or a @reward[charm of vitality], all of which are described in the <a href=\"https://5etools-mirror-1.github.io/book.html#DMG\">Dungeon Master's Guide</a>.</li><li class=\"rd__li \">One of the charms described in the \"<a href=\"https://5etools-mirror-1.github.io/rewards.html#blankhash,flstsource:idrotf=1\">New Chwinga Charms</a>\" section in appendix C.</li></ul><p>The chwingas remain docile unless a character acts aggressively toward them, whereupon they try to hide in nearby rocks, plants, or snowdrifts. They won't come out until they no longer feel threatened by the humanoids in their presence. Clever players might devise creative ways to lure the chwingas out of hiding, perhaps by doing something odd to gain their attention (such as engaging in a snowball fight or dancing in the snow). As the DM, you determine the success of such efforts.</p></div></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><h2 class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"111\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Concluding the Quest</span></h2> <p>If the characters return with a live @creature[chwinga|IDRotF], Dannika pays their promised reward of 25 gp, and they get to keep the @item[lantern of tracking|IDRotF].

Bremen's harbor has frozen, requiring local fishers to haul their boats across the ice to put them in the lake. Visitors who lack a boat can reach Bremen only by crossing the river, which is mostly frozen over. Targos, Termalaine, and Lonelywood are all visible from the docks on clear days.</p><p>If Auril's everlasting winter has one benefit, it's that the hardy folk of Bremen are spared the seasonal floods that normally threaten the town in early summer. That's not to say that the long nights, frigid air, and howling blizzards provide any comfort. They don't.</p><p>Twice in the past two months, residents of Bremen have had to mount search parties for their town speaker and oldest living resident, Dorbulgruf Shalescar, and twice they've found him wandering the frozen shores of the Shaengarne in heavy furs, with no memory of how he got there. Dorbulgruf, old even by dwarf standards, isn't long for this world. Many locals fear the same is true of the town itself, if Auril's brutal winter does not abate.</p><hr class=\"rd__hr rd__hr--section\" /><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--0\"><h1 class=\"rd__h rd__h--0\" data-title-index=\"113\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Bremen in a Nutshell</span></h1> <p><b>Friendliness</b> ❄❄❄<b>Services</b> ❄<b>Comfort</b> ❄❄</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"114\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Available Quest.</span></span> <p>\"Lake Monster\".</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div><ul class=\"rd__list rd__list-hang-notitle\"><li class=\"rd__li \"><p class=\"rd__p-list-item\"><span class=\"bold rd__list-item-name\">Population.</span> 150.</p></li></ul></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"115\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Leader.</span></span> <p>Speaker Dorbulgruf Shalescar (lawful good shield dwarf @creature[commoner]) speaks for the townsfolk.

If the characters ask Cora for more information, she says that her son had joined a search party to find Speaker Shalescar after he went missing during a blizzard one afternoon. The speaker was brought back safe and sound, but Huarwar got separated from the others and didn't find his way home until the following morning.

He left with them willingly, taking the shard with him and telling his mother that he would never return. The tieflings wore amulets that looked much like the shard in Huarwar's possession. Cora misses her son terribly and she hopes he is still alive.

In return, the druid expects the plesiosaurus to attack fishing boats from Bremen, thus depriving the fishers of their livelihood and ultimately forcing the villagers to leave.

It begins when the characters learn about a group of shield dwarves who were forced to abandon a sled loaded with iron ingots, which they were transporting from the mines at the base of Kelvin's Cairn. The ingots belong to the Battlehammer clan and are stamped with the clan's iconic symbol, a foaming mug. The dwarves ask the characters to retrieve the sled and deliver the ingots safely to Blackiron Blades, for which each character will receive a gemstone as payment. Characters who complete this quest also earn a 10 percent discount on goods bought at Blackiron Blades—a little thank-you from the establishment's grateful owner.</p><p>Complications arise when goblins find the sled before the characters do. The characters must either fight the goblins or finagle the ingots from them using guile or stealth. To further complicate matters, the goblins have a wagon pulled by hungry polar bears. The bears aren't fussy about what they eat, so clever characters might think to turn them against the goblins.</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><h2 class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"149\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Getting the Quest</span></h2> <p>Three frostbitten shield dwarves approach the characters at the Northlook or in the snow-covered street:</p><div class=\"rd__b-special rd__b-inset rd__b-inset--readaloud \"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2-inset rd__h--2-inset-no-name\"><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-special-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></span><p>Three stocky figures bundled in cold weather garb stumble toward you.

The tracks lead south.

Harnessed to this conveyance are two roaring polar bears that don't look happy.</p><div class=\"float-clear\"></div></div><p>These goblins were rolling across the tundra when their advance scout, a trained @creature[hawk], spotted the abandoned sled. The one-eared @creature[goblin boss], Izobai, sent six @creature[Goblin||goblins] forth to seize the sled and its cargo, while she and two @creature[Goblin||goblins] stayed behind to guard the wagon and keep an eye on the two @creature[Polar Bear||polar bears] that pull it.</p><p>At the start of the encounter, the characters are 120 feet behind the sled, and the goblins' wagon is 120 feet farther still. The goblins hauling the sled are too distracted to notice they're being followed, so the characters have surprise.</p><p>The sled weighs 300 pounds, and the iron ingots add another 600 pounds of weight to it. A single goblin can push or drag 240 pounds, so it takes at least four of them to move the sled. If they come under attack, the goblins take cover behind the sled and retaliate with ranged attacks. On the goblins' first turn in combat, one of them blows a horn to alert Izobai, who climbs to the roof of the wagon with a lit torch in one hand and her hooded hawk perched on her other arm. From this perch, she watches the battle unfold. If she spots enemies within 60 feet of the wagon, she orders the two goblins inside the wagon to shoot arrows at these enemies through gaps in the wagon's walls. These two goblins have three-quarters cover.</p><p>If five or more goblins are killed, or if Izobai is killed or captured, the remaining goblins are willing to negotiate a truce, though it's up to the characters to initiate the negotiations. The goblins are prepared to give up the iron ingots in exchange for their lives and freedom.</p><p>The prolonged winter has made the goblins as miserable as everyone else in Icewind Dale. If the characters act kindly toward the goblins, by offering them a blanket or some other gift, the goblins give up the sled and the ingots and allow the characters to be on their way. The goblins hail from the fortress of Karkolohk (see \"Karkolohk\"). Their job is to scour the tundra for food and treasure, as well as creatures to enslave, but they are cold and eager to return home.</p><p>Izobai fights only in self-defense. If defeat seems inevitable, she uses her torch to set fire to the wagon and flees into the tundra with her hawk, her treasure (see below), and any goblins in the vehicle. The wagon contains goblin beds made of straw; they ignite quickly, turning the vehicle into a raging inferno by the start of Izobai's next turn.</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"155\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Freeing the Bears.</span></span> <p>A character who succeeds on a DC 12 Wisdom (@skill[Animal Handling]) check can approach the polar bears without aggravating them and use an action to free one of them from its harness.

A freed polar bear does not attack the character who released it, but all other creatures on the battlefield are fair game. It would sooner eat a goblin than anything else, given how badly the goblins have treated the bears.

Most of the town's buildings, which date back to the town's Cormyrean founders, line the path that winds down the steep slope from the Caer to the harbor, whose docks are perched on the rocky shore. Noteworthy places in town are marked on map 1.3, and map 1.4 shows the floor plan of the Caer.</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><h2 class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"166\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">The Caer</span></h2> <p><i>Castle residence of the town speaker</i></p><p>This small castle was built over four hundred years ago by the Dinev family from Cormyr, before Ten-Towns existed as anything more than a few scattered camps of explorers living off the land. The Dinevs hoped to claim sovereignty over the unsettled lands of Icewind Dale. When the castle, dubbed Caer-Dineval, was completed, the workers and their families settled in the outbuildings they had constructed farther down the cliff, along with the families of the retainers the Dinevs had brought with them. Over the next few years, many explorers in the region came to see the Caer for themselves, and some built cottages in the shadow of its walls. No sooner had the small town taken hold than marauding orcs swept down from the tundra to put it to the torch. The town's residents tried to take refuge in the castle, but the Dinevs, alarmed by the size of the orc horde, barred the gates and refused to open them. The orcs fell upon the stranded people and slaughtered them to the last one. The Dinevs survived the initial assault, but not the siege that followed. After three weeks of being confined in the Caer, the Dinevs were so weakened by hunger that they were unable to resist when the orcs scaled the castle walls. Thus, the Dinev family's brief rule in Icewind Dale came to a bloody end.</p><p>The Caer remained in the orcs' possession for several years, until they were driven out by a small army of human settlers from other parts of the dale who banded together. The victors claimed the castle and its lands, and those with families brought them here to settle. Their descendants live here to this day and keep alive the memory of their ancestors' deeds.</p><p>Today, the keep is the residence of the town speaker, Crannoc Siever, who recently made the mistake of opening his doors to the Knights of the Black Sword. This group consists of people from all walks of life who owe their lives to the archdevil Levistus (see \"Black Swords\" below for detailed descriptions of the castle and the cult of Levistus).</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><h2 class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"167\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Dinev's Rest</span></h2> <p><i>Closed inn</i></p><p>At the south end of town is Caer-Dineval's inn, a drafty old building with boarded-up windows and a crooked weathervane shaped like a rearing dragon. The place has been out of business for almost a year.</p><p>Six @creature[duergar] hide inside the ramshackle inn and remain out of sight until Xardorok's chardalyn dragon attacks the town (see <a href=\"https://5etools-mirror-1.github.io/adventure.html#IDRotF,14\">chapter 4</a>).</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><h2 class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"168\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">The Uphill Climb</span></h2> <p><i>Tavern</i></p><p>This tavern is situated northwest of the Caer, where it offers a spectacular view of the lake and the frozen docks. The Climb serves hot chowder but is all out of beer and spirits, which might explain why locals don't frequent the place as much as they used to. The proprietor, a rugged middle-aged man named Roark (lawful good human @creature[commoner]), blames the cursed winter and the closing of the Easthaven ferry for his business woes. Although he has spare rooms with empty beds, he claims to have no available guest accommodations. If adventurers are looking for a place to rest, he suggests that they try the Caer. Roark can't guarantee that Speaker Crannoc Siever's attendants will welcome them with open arms, given how sick the speaker has been of late.</p><p>Roark and some of his patrons know something is amiss in the castle, but they refrain from talking about it. Roark figures that if he steers adventurers toward the castle, they'll figure out what's going on by themselves.</p><p></p><div class=\"float-clear\"></div><div><div class=\"rd__wrp-image relative\">\n\t\t\t<a href=\"https://5etools-mirror-1.github.io/img/adventure/IDRotF/026-01-013.caer-dineval.png\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" title=\"Caer-Dineval is built on the rocky shore of Lac Dinneshere, with Kelvin's Cairn looming behind it\">\n\t\t\t\t<img class=\"rd__image\" src=\"https://5etools-mirror-1.github.io/img/adventure/IDRotF/026-01-013.caer-dineval.png\" />\n\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t</div><div class=\"rd__image-title\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rd__image-title-inner \">Caer-Dineval is built on the rocky shore of Lac Dinneshere, with Kelvin's Cairn looming behind it</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</div></div><p></p></div></div><hr class=\"rd__hr rd__hr--section\" /><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--0\"><h1 class=\"rd__h rd__h--0\" data-title-index=\"169\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Black Swords</span></h1> <p>The characters don't get this quest in the customary way, which is to say that the residents of Caer-Dineval aren't counting on adventurers to help them. The quest falls into the party's lap if the characters decide to visit the Caer. Here are a couple reasons why the characters might go there:</p><ul class=\"rd__list\"><li class=\"rd__li \">Looking for a good night's rest in Caer-Dineval, the characters are directed to the castle by Roark or some other NPC.</li><li class=\"rd__li \">A sad story told by Cora Mulphoon, the proprietor of the Buried Treasures inn in Bremen (see \"Buried Treasures\"), might spur the characters into searching the castle for her missing son, Huarwar.</li></ul><p>Crannoc Siever, the town speaker, resides in the castle and is also a prisoner. Devil-worshiping cultists calling themselves the Knights of the Black Sword have taken over and confined Crannoc to his quarters while spreading stories about the speaker's ill health to conceal their presence and restrict access to the castle. The cultists keep the speaker alive in case they need him to make a public appearance. They can also use him as a hostage if the Ten-Towners take up arms against them. These devil worshipers keep a low profile while seeking out new members to join their ranks.</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><h2 class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"170\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Knights of the Black Sword</span></h2> <p>The Knights of the Black Sword are a secret society of cultists devoted to Levistus, the archdevil who rules Stygia, the sixth layer of the Nine Hells, from the confines of an ice prison from which he cannot escape.</p><p>Most of the cultists are Icewind Dale natives who would have perished in the wilderness had Levistus not intervened on their behalf. The cultists' stories are all the same: the archdevil reached out to them in their minds as they were freezing to death, offering a second chance at life in exchange for their absolute devotion. After they agreed to follow Levistus, a pale glow caught their eye in the snow nearby, leading to the discovery of a sword-shaped amulet of chardalyn. Each of these amulets has an inner radiance that provides warmth and aid, protecting its wearer against the cold while guiding them safely back to civilization. Once its wearer reaches Ten-Towns, the talisman loses its inner radiance, yet the cultists keep their amulets as signs of their devotion to the archduke of Stygia (see the \"Chardalyn Amulets\" sidebar).</p><p>The Knights of the Black Sword have members scattered throughout Ten-Towns. They welcome new members and answer to Levistus, who speaks to them infrequently using a powerful form of cross-planar telepathy. Levistus has recently called upon them to help another of their master's disciples—an albino tiefling wizard named @creature[Avarice|IDRotF]—achieve her goals. Even though they find her demanding and difficult to live with, they dare not defy her.</p><p>Levistus has warned the Knights of the Black Sword that duergar are plotting the destruction of Ten-Towns. He believes the duergar are acting on behalf of Asmodeus, the Lord of the Hells and his infernal jailer, but has not shared this information with the cult. The cult's oldest living member, Hethyl (a peg-legged shield dwarf who has lost her right foot to frostbite), hates duergar as most dwarves do. She has convinced the other cult members to forge alliances with anyone willing to oppose the duergar, including stray bands of adventurers.</p><p>The Caer serves as the cult's headquarters. The cult's presence is the worst-kept secret in Caer-Dineval, though few locals ever speak of it.</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><h3 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"171\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Game Statistics</span></h3> <p>The Knights of the Black Sword are lawful evil @creature[Cultist||cultists] and @creature[Cult Fanatic||cult fanatics] who speak Common and Infernal.

If the time is right, however, they welcome the characters with open arms. That time comes when Levistus instructs the cultists, in no uncertain terms, to form an alliance with the party. For that to happen, one of the following statements must be true:</p><ul class=\"rd__list\"><li class=\"rd__li \">One of the characters has the Runaway Author secret (see <a href=\"https://5etools-mirror-1.github.io/adventure.html#IDRotF,20\">appendix B</a>).</li><li class=\"rd__li \">The characters found and killed the group of duergar hiding in Dinev's Rest (see \"Dinev's Rest\").</li><li class=\"rd__li \">The characters meddled in the affairs of Nildar Sunblight (see \"The Unseen\") or his older brother, Durth (see <a href=\"https://5etools-mirror-1.github.io/adventure.html#IDRotF,12\">chapter 2</a>).</li></ul><p>Once the cultists are told that the characters' goals align with theirs, they will do everything in their power to make the characters feel safe and happy, short of giving up their stronghold and their leverage over Speaker Crannoc.</p><p>Levistus tells the cultists to terminate the alliance if one of the following events comes to pass:</p><ul class=\"rd__list\"><li class=\"rd__li \">The characters attack any member of the cult other than @creature[Kadroth|IDRotF], whom Levistus secretly despises.</li><li class=\"rd__li \">The characters harm @creature[Avarice|IDRotF], the albino tiefling wizard, or inhibit her efforts to plunder the lost city of Ythryn.</li><li class=\"rd__li \">The characters give up their fight against the duergar menace threatening Ten-Towns.</li></ul><div class=\"rd__b-special rd__b-inset \"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2-inset\" data-title-index=\"174\"><h4 class=\"entry-title-inner\">Chardalyn Amulets</h4><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"> <span class=\"rd__title-link rd__title-link--inset\">p39</span><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-special-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></span><p>The chardalyn amulets worn by the Knights of the Black Sword have been corrupted by the magic of Levistus.

Take the character's player aside to describe how the player should roleplay the new alignment.

Warding the castle entrance are thick, battle-hardened wooden doors. Four cylindrical guard towers have wind-worn flags bearing the town's heraldry fluttering above their tiled, conical roofs. These towers are connected by icy battlements and parapets. Atop the castle walls and within the guard towers, torches flicker.</p><div class=\"float-clear\"></div></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><h3 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"177\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">General Features</span></h3> <p>The snow-covered ground outside the castle is 10 feet lower than the castle's courtyard. Thus, the battlements and parapets that top the outer walls appear 20 feet high from the outside and are 10 feet high on the inside. Icy stone steps at either end of the courtyard climb to the tops of these walls, which are unmanned. Arrow slits in the outer walls of the guard towers and central keep provide three-quarters cover to those standing behind them.</p><p>Most of the castle is lit by torches regardless of the time of day.

Caer-Konig started as a camp for a group of mountaineers from the northern Moonsea region. As the camp grew, a wooden palisade was added to discourage raiders. Later came the stone castle of Caer-Konig. Alas, neither the palisade nor the castle fared well; both fell to orcs before falling into ruin.</p><p>Caer-Konig as it is known today consists of terraced rows of houses that recede from the shore of Lac Dinneshere like the tiers of an amphitheater. The harbor is frozen, its docks skewed and broken by the shifting ice. Buried under the snow on the slopes above the last row of houses are the ruins of the Caer that gave the town its name—a reminder to the people of Caer-Konig that nothing lasts in this corner of the world.</p><p>Travel to and from this remote town was expedited by the ferry that ran out of Easthaven, but with the ferry shut down, Caer-Konig is completely cut off by mountains, lake, and snow. Forced to live on what they can haul out of the iced-over lake, the people of Caer-Konig are bitter and angry. They believe that the rest of Ten-Towns has abandoned them. The only thing that keeps the townsfolk from leaving is the beer at the local tavern, which never seems to run out.</p><p>As if things weren't bad enough, the town has suffered several mysterious break-ins recently, with no evidence of the intruders except dwarven boot tracks in the snow leading north. Since there are no known settlements in that direction, the townsfolk assume that Auril's everlasting winter has taken its toll on the dwarves of Kelvin's Cairn, forcing them to come down from the mountain in search of food or beer. In truth, the town is beset by @condition[invisible] duergar searching for chardalyn.</p><p>The town speaker, a heavy-drinking dragonborn named Trovus, patrols at night to keep an eye out for trouble. In his inebriated state, however, Trovus is prone to wandering out onto the icy lake or passing out on the ramshackle docks, and he almost never remembers his nightly patrols once his head clears.</p><hr class=\"rd__hr rd__hr--section\" /><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--0\"><h1 class=\"rd__h rd__h--0\" data-title-index=\"217\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Caer-Konig in a Nutshell</span></h1> <p><b>Friendliness</b> ❄❄<b>Services</b> ❄❄<b>Comfort</b> ❄❄❄</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"218\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Available Quest.</span></span> <p>\"The Unseen\".</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div><ul class=\"rd__list rd__list-hang-notitle\"><li class=\"rd__li \"><p class=\"rd__p-list-item\"><span class=\"bold rd__list-item-name\">Population.</span> 150.</p></li></ul></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"219\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Leader.</span></span> <p>Speaker Trovus (neutral good silver dragonborn @creature[veteran]), a retired adventurer, represents the town.

He's been patrolling at night looking for thieves, but after yet another night of heavy drinking, he passed out in the snow after a few hours. He has no recollection of how he ended up in the snow pile or why he was outside drinking in the first place.</p><p>If he's asked about the thieves, Trovus takes a deep breath, trying to suppress his hiccups, before explaining the situation:</p><div class=\"rd__b-special rd__b-inset rd__b-inset--readaloud \"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2-inset rd__h--2-inset-no-name\"><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-special-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></span><p>\"The town has had some thievery troubles.

Not yet, anyway. But I have a knack for this stuff.\"</p><div class=\"float-clear\"></div></div><p>If he's not stopped, Trovus starts a long speech about the adventures he went on in his younger days. His stories include one where he kicked a half-ogre into a river and watched it float away while it yelled profanities at him. Another tells of the time he tricked a group of kobolds into believing he was a dragon in humanoid form.</p><p>If the characters ask about the missing lantern, he offers to take them to the local inn so they can talk to the Shorard sisters, who run the establishment. He seems less bothered by the cold than anyone else in the settlement, due to his silver dragon heritage. As they walk, Trovus talks about what has been taken from Caer-Konig over the past three nights:</p><ul class=\"rd__list\"><li class=\"rd__li \">A color-switching magic lantern, taken from the local inn</li><li class=\"rd__li \">A pair of goats, stolen from the local tavern</li><li class=\"rd__li \">A small sack of pearls carved into decorative beads, gone missing from the stores of Frozenfar Expeditions</li></ul><p>If the characters inquire about a reward for dealing with the thieves, Trovus explains that the town doesn't have the coin to pay someone to investigate the matter. Most of the valuables in the village have disappeared already, so there's little left to use as compensation. </p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><h2 class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"229\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Helpful Sisters</span></h2> <p>Trovus leads the characters through Caer-Konig to the Northern Light on the eastern edge of town.

I'm telling you, Trovus, one day you're going to have to stop relying on the kindness of strangers.\"</p><p>The woman then opens a door into what looks like a kitchen and calls out, \"Heat up something for Trovus. He's been out 'patrolling' again.\"</p><div class=\"float-clear\"></div></div><p>The woman, Allie, is one of the Shorard sisters (neutral good human @creature[Commoner||commoners]), who own the inn. The other owner, Cori, is working in the kitchen. Allie settles Trovus into a chair before approaching the characters.</p><p>She confirms that the town has been experiencing break-ins and robberies lately, but no one has witnessed a potential culprit. The only clue is a set of tracks leading in the direction of Kelvin's Cairn. Allie thinks the tracks were made by dwarves who live in the valley at the base of Kelvin's Cairn. She suspects that the endless winter has made the dwarves desperate for food and ale, though she can't explain why the dwarves would steal the inn's lantern and other valuables. Allie is also surprised that no one in Caer-Konig has seen or heard the dwarves, remarking that \"A quiet dwarf is an oxymoron.\"</p><p>Any interaction with Allie is interrupted when Cori exits the kitchen: </p><div class=\"rd__b-special rd__b-inset rd__b-inset--readaloud \"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2-inset rd__h--2-inset-no-name\"><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-special-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></span><p>The door to the kitchen swings open as a stern-looking woman enters holding a steaming bowl of soup.

Besides, what use do hungry dwarves have for a lantern?\"</p><div class=\"float-clear\"></div></div><p>If the characters ask Cori for details, she explains that the magic lantern that used to decorate the outside of their inn doesn't do anything useful other than light up the area with different colors.</p><p>If asked about a reward for dealing with the thieves, the sisters say they have little coin, but they can provide food and comfortable beds in exchange for the party's help. They'll even throw in a few flagons of beer if the characters can bring their magic lantern back to the inn. </p><p>If the characters accept the quest, Allie takes them to the back of the inn, where faint footprints lead toward Kelvin's Cairn. If they refuse the quest, Caer-Konig continues to be tormented by @condition[invisible] thieves until the duergar stop searching the town for chardalyn.</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><h3 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"230\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Getting a Dogsled</span></h3> <p>If the characters are interested in following the suspicious tracks, the Shorard sisters suggest they visit Frozenfar Expeditions and secure a dogsled before setting out on their adventure. If the characters do so, they discover that Jarthra, the mountain guide at Frozenfar Expeditions, is willing to accompany the characters for a small fee of 10 gp per day of travel. Jarthra has advantage on Wisdom (@skill[Survival]) checks made in the vicinity of Kelvin's Cairn.</p></div></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><h2 class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"231\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Following the Tracks</span></h2> <p>The tracks leading away from the inn have been partly filled with blowing snow, making them appear as small depressions. Once the characters get about 50 feet away from the inn and its outbuildings, they discover that the tracks have been completely obscured.</p><p>If the characters wait until morning to set out, they find a set of fresh footprints left behind by a lone duergar scout. This duergar didn't enter any buildings, but simply looked around the village before leaving close to morning. Following the footprints leads to a different set of tracks, which were made by an ogre zombie pulling a dogsled. These new tracks begin where the duergar tracks end, a quarter-mile outside of town. (The ogre zombie waited all night for the duergar to return. The duergar hopped onto the dogsled before ordering the ogre zombie to march.) Any character who examines these tracks and succeeds on a DC 15 Wisdom (@skill[Survival]) check identifies the creature tracks as belonging to an ogre. The characters can follow these fresh tracks, which head toward the mountain and then veer toward the duergar outpost hidden in the northeastern foothills of Kelvin's Cairn.</p><p>Once the characters get within a mile of the outpost, they discover that the wind has erased the tracks they've been following, making it difficult for them to find the exact destination. For every hour the characters spend searching the foothills, have them make a DC 15 Wisdom (@skill[Survival]) group check. Jarthra contributes to this group check, if she's present, and has advantage on her roll. If the group check succeeds, the characters find the outpost. If the group check fails, they didn't find the outpost during that hour but can try again. If they fail two of these group checks in a row, the characters have a random encounter in the wilderness, possibly during a blizzard (see \"Wilderness Encounters\").</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><h2 class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"232\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Approaching the Outpost</span></h2> <p>The duergar outpost, a recent addition to the foothills north of Kelvin's Cairn, was carved out of a hillside. Although the duergar are based mainly in Xardorok's mountain fortress (described in chapter 3), they come to this outpost to resupply and rest before searching nearby settlements for chardalyn.</p><p>When the characters find the duergar outpost, read:</p><div class=\"rd__b-special rd__b-inset rd__b-inset--readaloud \"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2-inset rd__h--2-inset-no-name\"><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-special-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></span><p>A blocky stronghold bereft of warmth or charm juts out of a hillside in a rough crescent shape. Only part of its construction is visible; the rest is buried in the stone.</p><p>A large double door of stone serves as the main entrance. The terrain leading to it is a gently upward-sloping plain covered with fresh snow. A stream used to flow out of a barred culvert northeast of the main entrance, but the waterway has frozen. Two other barred openings can be seen along the stronghold's northern wall. Anyone positioned behind these openings would have an unobstructed view of the hillside.</p><p>Closer to you, separated from the rest of the stronghold, is a snow-covered stone bunker perforated by arrow slits.</p><div class=\"float-clear\"></div></div><p>Two duergar watch for approaching intruders. One is stationed in the bunker (area O1), the other in the overlook (area O3). These duergar are tired and bored, but they notice characters who are so incautious as to carry light sources or otherwise announce their presence.</p><p>If the overlook duergar sees what she perceives to be a threat, she sounds the alarm as she runs down to the main entrance (area O2) to pull up the drawbridge, taking 2 rounds to do so. The duergar in the bunker is armed with a heavy crossbow ([[/r 1d10]] piercing damage) and takes pot shots at visible threats.</p><p>Characters who succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity (@skill[Stealth]) check can approach the stronghold undetected by hugging the north cliff and moving behind the bunker and below the openings of the overlook. Once they reach the mouth of the frozen river, they can crawl through the culvert (which leads under area O2) or quietly approach the main entrance without being detected.</p><div class=\"rd__b-special rd__b-inset \"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2-inset\" data-title-index=\"233\"><h4 class=\"entry-title-inner\">Roleplaying the Duergar</h4><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"> <span class=\"rd__title-link rd__title-link--inset\">p49</span><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-special-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></span><p>When the characters arrive, the outpost contains five @creature[duergar] (including Nildar), who behave as described here.</p><p>Before entering combat, these duergar use their Enlarge trait to increase their size.

No one knows who built this structure or why; the townsfolk maintain that the stones were there when the town's founder, a Chondathan named Dougan Dubrace, first happened upon this fishing spot. Scholars have tried to research the origin of the structure's name, but all they have found are allusions to a creature named Thruun in the oldest legends of the northern folk.

Years ago, a frost druid cast an @spell[awaken] spell on the mammoth. Last year, a group of adventurers killed Garagai, the mammoth's frost giant master. Norsu has never recovered from the loss and, to this day, watches over its master's frozen corpse, unwilling to leave its side. The winter wolves, who served Garagai as faithful friends, look after the mammoth. Although Norsu feeds on plants, not meat, it delights in killing humanoids to avenge Garagai's death. Slaying the mammoth is a tall order, so characters would be wise to flee from Norsu or try to reason with it.</p><p>Norsu and the winter wolves reside in an ice lodge built by Garagai. The wolves try to entice the characters into the lodge, knowing that Norsu will enjoy the exercise of killing them. Held captive in the lodge are Silja and Finn Dejarr, two teenaged siblings from Dougan's Hole who have been missing for the past four days and are presumed dead. The wolves are holding the siblings in a cage and feeding them raw meat to keep them alive until Dougan's Hole pays a ransom for their safe return. Characters lured to the ice lodge by the wolves or hired by Speaker Durmoot to find the missing teenagers can try to rescue Silja and Finn from the frost giant's lodge and see them safely back to town.</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><h2 class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"263\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Getting the Quest</span></h2> <p>If Dougan's Hole is the starting town for this adventure, the characters already know some of what's going on.

Here's how the encounter plays out:</p><ul class=\"rd__list\"><li class=\"rd__li \">Koran acts as the \"good\" wolf while his brother plays the \"bad\" wolf. This act has worked before on the dim-witted locals; the wolves assume the characters will be fooled just as easily.</li><li class=\"rd__li \">Koran approaches the characters, limping on one back leg and whimpering like a pitiful dog, making himself as unthreatening as possible. Kanan remains nearby but out of sight. Any character who succeeds on a DC 15 Wisdom (@skill[Insight]) check sees through Koran's ruse, noticing how the wolf sometimes forgets which leg he's supposedly limping on.</li><li class=\"rd__li \">Koran claims that he was routinely kicked by his master, a mean old frost giant named Garagai. Koran also says that Garagai kidnapped two townsfolk and is holding them prisoner in his lodge more than half a day's walk west of town. Koran wants to help the characters free the prisoners, to get back at Garagai for his abuse. If the characters believe this story, Koran leads them to the lodge while Kanan follows their tracks and their scent, remaining out of sight.</li><li class=\"rd__li \">If Koran is unable to convince the characters to follow it back to the frost giant's lodge, Kanan steps in and plays the \"bad\" wolf, baring his fangs and threatening to eat the characters unless they change their minds. Kanan pretends to be upset about the abuse Garagai inflicted on Koran. \"He'll think twice before he hurts one of us again,\" Kanan says with a growl. As earlier, a successful DC 15 Wisdom (@skill[Insight]) check allows a character to ascertain that the wolf is lying.</li></ul><p>If the wolves can't trick or scare the characters into accompanying them to the frost giant's lodge thirteen miles west of Dougan's Hole, they drop their act and try to appeal to the characters' consciences. \"It's awfully cold in that lodge,\" says Koran, to which his brother adds, \"They won't suffer much longer. It's only a matter of time before Garagai skins and eats them.\" The wolves then bolt away, heading toward the lodge and leaving tracks that the characters can follow, if they choose not to accompany the wolves.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><h2 class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"265\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Crossing the Tundra</span></h2> <p>The wilderness around Dougan's Hole is a frozen tundra. Snow falls frequently, adding to the snowpack and erasing tracks. There is a [[/r 1d100]] (50 percent) chance that the characters get caught in a blizzard on the way to the lodge (see \"Blizzards\"). If Kanan and Koran are with the party, they protect the characters from the worst of the storm, using their bodies to shield the characters until it passes. The wolves' presence also prevents the characters from getting lost or separated.</p><p>Also crossing the tundra are a pack of [[/r 1d6 + 1]] @creature[Wolf||wolves], prowling the white in search of food. Characters who make a successful DC 13 Intelligence (@skill[Nature]) check note that the wolves are gaunt from starvation.

The wolves offer to stand guard outside while the characters enter the lodge and free the prisoners. Characters who suspect treachery can, with a successful DC 15 Wisdom (@skill[Insight]) check, tell that the wolves are lying about Garagai—the frost giant is in fact inside the lodge. Are they afraid to face their master, perhaps, or is there another reason why the wolves won't enter the lodge? No ability check can answer this question; the characters must find out for themselves! In truth, the winter wolves expect Norsu to slaughter the characters, but in case that doesn't happen, they remain outside to attack any characters who try to flee. (Specifically, the wolves wait in area L1, east of the lodge's main entrance.) If one wolf is slain, the other flees to avoid a similar fate.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><h2 class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"267\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Lodge Locations</span></h2> <p>The ice lodge was where Garagai lived and entertained other frost giants.

This rare secretion is called thrym; remorhazes are known to exude small quantities of it shortly before they give birth. Alchemists use thrym to craft @item[Potion of Cold Resistance||potions of resistance (cold)] and other useful concoctions. A bottle of thrym sells for 250 gp. Any character who is proficient with alchemist's supplies can examine this residue and determine its true nature with a successful DC 11 Intelligence (@skill[Arcana]) check.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div></div></div></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><h2 class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"279\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Sneaking Out</span></h2> <p>With Silja and Finn in tow, the characters can try to sneak out of the lodge.

In the generations since, as other towns have settled into a predictable pattern of existence, Easthaven has continued to grow and reinvent itself. After the Eastway was paved, Easthaven evolved into a frontier traders' paradise, fueling the jealousy of its neighbors.</p><p>Easthaven's founders were thieves from the Duchy of Cape Velen, on a peninsula far to the south. They refused to kowtow to a powerful thieves' guild and were driven out. To this day, Easthaven honors its shady founders by declaring pickpocketing legal within the town limits—which explains the \"Watch thy pouch!\" signs posted in various local establishments.</p><p>Duergar have infiltrated the town of late, scouring Easthaven and the surrounding tundra for chardalyn fragments to bring back to their hidden mountain stronghold. The leader of these duergar is Durth Sunblight, the oldest living son of @creature[Xardorok Sunblight|IDRotF]. Durth and his gang have turned the frozen Easthaven ferry into a temporary base. Using their innate invisibility to move about unseen, the duergar betray their presence only by the footprints they leave in the snow.</p><p>Another occurrence of note is the recent capture of a Red Wizard of Thay who has been found guilty of killing a handful of dale-folk he had hired for an expedition. Speaker Danneth Waylen has issued a decree that the wizard be tied to a stake and burned alive—an event that a lot of Easthaven residents are looking forward to.</p><hr class=\"rd__hr rd__hr--section\" /><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--0\"><h1 class=\"rd__h rd__h--0\" data-title-index=\"283\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Easthaven in a Nutshell</span></h1> <p><b>Friendliness</b> ❄❄<b>Services</b> ❄❄❄<b>Comfort</b> ❄❄❄</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"284\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Available Quest.</span></span> <p>\"Toil and Trouble\".</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div><ul class=\"rd__list rd__list-hang-notitle\"><li class=\"rd__li \"><p class=\"rd__p-list-item\"><span class=\"bold rd__list-item-name\">Population.</span> 750.</p></li></ul></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"285\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Leaders.</span></span> <p>Speaker Danneth Waylen (chaotic good human @creature[commoner]), respected for his humility and forthrightness.

But the boat and much of Easthaven's harbor is trapped in ice, and Speaker Waylen has declared that ferry service must cease until the ice thaws—which, given Auril's temperament, seems unlikely to happen soon. The ferry's tiefling owner and operator, Scython, spends his idle time at the Wet Trout (described below). In Scython's absence, the ferry has become a base of operations for a @creature[duergar mind master|MTF] (see <a href=\"https://5etools-mirror-1.github.io/adventure.html#IDRotF,21\">appendix C</a>) named Durth Sunblight. He and three other @creature[duergar] named Klaska, Ossyl, and Zublorr are using the ferry's aft cabin as a lair, but only Durth is present when the characters first arrive at the ferry. The other duergar are searching Easthaven for chardalyn.</p><p>The duergar are cautious enough to turn @condition[invisible] while moving through town and on the docks, but not smart enough to cover the tracks they make in the snow. Characters who search for tracks on the snow-covered dock and succeed on a DC 10 Wisdom (@skill[Survival]) check can discern [[/r 1d4]] distinct sets of dwarven boot prints leading to and from the ferry.

The space is roughly 10 feet square and contains four sleeping bags, packs of stolen rations, and a rolled-up map of Icewind Dale that marks the location of every Ten-Towns settlement, as well as the locations of the duergar outpost near Kelvin's Cairn (see \"Outpost Locations\") and Sunblight, the fortress hidden in the mountains (described in <a href=\"https://5etools-mirror-1.github.io/adventure.html#IDRotF,13\">chapter 3</a>). All of the place names on the map are written in Dwarvish.</p><p>Lurking in the cabin is Durth Sunblight. He knows when someone else boards the ship by the creaking of the deck. As a precaution, he turns @condition[invisible] and stands in an empty corner at the back of the cabin. If an intruder detects him or tries to steal his map, he attacks. If he's reduced to 20 hit points or fewer, he shrinks to Tiny size and flees through a 4-inch-diameter rathole, exiting outside the ship 5 feet above the frozen harbor and 5 feet away from the dock. If he escapes, Durth returns to his father's fortress in the mountains (see <a href=\"https://5etools-mirror-1.github.io/adventure.html#IDRotF,13\">chapter 3</a>), abandoning his duergar companions.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><h3 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"292\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Development</span></h3> <p>Durth's companions have been scouring Easthaven for chardalyn.

If they find Durth's dead body or no signs of him at all aboard the ferry, they abandon the ship and don't return to it.</p><p>If the characters capture Durth, he warns his captors that he's the son of @creature[Xardorok Sunblight|IDRotF], who will soon claim Icewind Dale as his kingdom, and it would be unwise for them to earn the wrath of so powerful a figure. Durth doesn't give up any other information. His companions are similarly tight-lipped; however, threats to Durth's life or the clever use of a @spell[suggestion] spell or similar magic can persuade one or more them to reveal the following additional information:</p><ul class=\"rd__list\"><li class=\"rd__li \">Xardorok has a fortress hidden in the mountains.

The tavern's current owner and proprietor is Nymetra Myskyn, a chaotic neutral dragonborn @creature[berserker] of white dragon ancestry. Although she can be crusty and full of complaints, Nymetra is not discouraged by the Everlasting Rime, which she regards as a test of Ten-Towns' mettle.

Rinaldo (lawful good strongheart halfling @creature[commoner]), a self-styled bard kept around to entertain guests, is fond of plucking his fiddle while recounting his tale: that the White Lady's husband was a miser who kept his treasure in a heavy, locked chest that never left his side. Perhaps it was this heavy chest, suggests Rinaldo, that capsized his boat and sent the man to his sunken grave, or perhaps it was the fright of seeing his dead wife that caused him to capsize the boat and drown. Either way, Rinaldo is certain that the man's treasure lies at the bottom of the lake, waiting for some intrepid explorer to find it. The inn's sullen, elderly proprietor, Bartaban (neutral good human @creature[commoner]), has heard the halfling's rambling far too often to be humored by it.</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><h3 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"296\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Séance</span></h3> <p>Rinaldo is planning to conduct a séance in a back room of the inn and has invited half a dozen other guests (@creature[Commoner||commoners]) to join him.

Tell us what you've seen!\" After a moment of silence, thick frost forms on the inside of the room's windows, turning them opaque, and the candles go out one by one.</p><div class=\"float-clear\"></div></div><p>Rinaldo senses that the White Lady's spirit is close and urges the characters to reach out to it. Ask the players in turn what their characters say or do. The characters who try to help Rinaldo must make a DC 12 Charisma (@skill[Persuasion]) group check. If the group check fails, the White Lady's spirit manifests as a poltergeist and attacks the party, frightening away the other participants. This @creature[poltergeist] uses the @creature[specter] stat block, with the changes outlined in the \"Variant: Poltergeist\" sidebar that appears with it in the <a href=\"https://5etools-mirror-1.github.io/book.html#MM\">Monster Manual</a>.</p><p>If the group check succeeds, Rinaldo can sense that the spirit is receptive and urges the characters to ask it questions. The spirit replies truthfully by tracing short, two- to five-word answers on the room's frosted windows. If doing that becomes too cumbersome, the spirit uses Rinaldo as a vessel to whisper the answers. If the spirit doesn't know an answer or thinks a question is foolish, it shatters a window instead. Once it answers three questions, the spirit departs, and Rinaldo can't try to summon it again until he finishes a long rest.</p><p>Here's what the White Lady knows about the recent happenings around Lac Dinneshere:</p><ul class=\"rd__list\"><li class=\"rd__li \">The castle in Caer-Dineval has become a base for a devil-worshiping cult.</li><li class=\"rd__li \">Gray-skinned dwarves have been stalking the streets of Easthaven, Caer-Dineval, and Caer-Konig while @condition[invisible].

They're too late to save @creature[Dzaan|IDRotF], but they might encounter a magical copy of him again in chapter 2 (see \"Lost Spire of Netheril\").</p><p>The captain of Easthaven's militia, Imdra Arlaggath, takes notice of the characters during the burning and offers them a quest. Some fishers have gone missing on Lac Dinneshere, and she wants the characters to take a boat and search for them. She knows where the fishers like to fish and urges the characters to search that part of the lake first. If they heed Imdra's advice, they find the fishers' boats pulled up on the ice within short walking distance from a frozen cave previously hidden under snow and ice. This cave, the characters soon discover, is the lair of a hag named Maud Chiselbone.</p><p>Characters who explore the cave complex find the bodies of the fishers, as well as Maud's @item[cauldron of plenty|IDRotF] (see <a href=\"https://5etools-mirror-1.github.io/adventure.html#IDRotF,22,%7b%40item%20cauldron%20of%20plenty%7cidrotf%7d,0\">appendix D</a>).

Too much ale also leads to foolhardy decisions. Such was the fate of four old anglers from Easthaven, who abandoned their trusty boat, <i>Bunch o' Knuckleheads</i>, to follow a tantalizing scent emanating from the mouth of a lakeside cave. Inside, they encountered a hag named Maud Chiselbone and a spicy concoction she prepared using her @item[cauldron of plenty|IDRotF].

Heaped around this block are rusty hatchets and the flayed corpses of the four fishers from Easthaven.

If the skeleton is destroyed, Maud assumes her true form and takes on the characters herself. She won't give up her lair or the magic cauldron without a fight.</p><p>If she is reduced to 9 hit points or fewer, Maud tries to make a deal. She agrees to surrender the cauldron and promises to deliver a chest filled with gold coins that lies in the muck at the bottom of Lac Dinneshere. If the deal is struck and the characters release her as promised, Maud returns to the lake to make good on her end of the bargain. As she departs, she tells the characters to wait in the caves until midnight, then head north along the shore for a mile.

He had no idea she worked for the Zhentarim. If the characters don't know where the Zhents took the cauldron, Waylen recalls that Prudence offhandedly mentioned having family in Targos. (Her \"family\" is the Zhentarim.) He suggests they search for the cauldron there. Characters can find Prudence Tarkwold at the Luskan Arms, where she has a private room to herself.

Barring the characters' intervention, the duergar use their weapons to shatter the chardalyn figurehead in area T6. The guards in area T17 interrupt the duergar but are no match for them. After killing the guards with their war picks, the duergar finish breaking apart the figurehead.</p><p>Each duergar carries one sack that can hold up to five 20-pound fragments of chardalyn. After filling their sacks, the duergar exit the Town Hall and travel to their hidden fortress in the mountains (described in <a href=\"https://5etools-mirror-1.github.io/adventure.html#IDRotF,13\">chapter 3</a>). Any tracks left by the duergar are obliterated after [[/r 1d4]] hours by blowing wind.</p><p>If too much time has passed to track the duergar, the characters have no way to know where they went—just as well, given the perils of the duergar fortress. A search of the Easthaven ferry yields no clues, as the duergar took all their belongings (including Durth's map) with them.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><h3 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"326\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Development</span></h3> <p>Unless they happen to be inside or near the Town Hall when the duergar arrive, the characters won't know about the theft until word reaches their ears the following day, when Speaker Waylen asks them to find the thieves and return the missing fragments of chardalyn, so that he can lock them up with the other pieces that the thieves left behind. Waylen is willing to pay 50 gp for each stolen fragment that is returned to him. If the characters aren't already aware of the properties of chardalyn, Waylen warns them about the demonic magic suffusing the crystal and urges them not to come in direct contact with any of the fragments.</p><p>Characters who are determined to find the stolen chardalyn fragments can question Easthaven's townsfolk to see if anyone saw suspicious activity on the night of the robbery. Any character who spends an hour knocking on doors and inquiring about town can make a DC 14 Charisma (@skill[Investigation]) check at the end of that hour. On a failed check, no useful information is obtained. If the check succeeds, the character is urged to speak with Scython, the tiefling ferryman, who spends most of his free time in a tavern called the Wet Trout. Scython is widely regarded as a font of useful information. Although he doesn't know anything about the duergar or the stolen chardalyn, he knows several rumors that might steer the characters in new directions (see \"The Wet Trout\"). Once the characters are 4th level, the adventure steers them toward the duergar fortress in <a href=\"https://5etools-mirror-1.github.io/adventure.html#IDRotF,13\">chapter 3</a>, where the stolen chardalyn fragments can be found (see area X26).</p></div></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><h2 class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"327\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Easthaven Town Hall (T1-T10)</span></h2> <p>Information about Easthaven's Town Hall is provided here, along with a map.

Those who succeed on a DC 20 Intelligence (@skill[History]) check realize that the figurehead depicts Errtu, a balor demon that terrorized Icewind Dale over a century ago. Characters who grew up in Icewind Dale have advantage on this check. The figurehead is a Large object with AC 13, a damage threshold of 5, 50 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage. It weighs 1,000 pounds.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div><p>A band of adventurers used a @spell[telekinesis] spell to raise the figurehead from the depths of Lac Dinneshere a few months ago and hauled it to Easthaven, hoping for a reward. What they got was hardly worth the effort, and Speaker Waylen doesn't know what else to do with the figurehead except store it here, out of the public eye. He fears the figurehead is tainted by demonic magic and has warned his staff not to touch it. A @spell[detect evil and good] spell or similar magic reveals that it's a desecrated object. Any creature that comes into contact with it must succeed on a DC 13 Charisma saving throw or gain the following flaw, which supersedes any conflicting personality trait: \"I suspect most Ten-Towners are members of a secret cult devoted to the Frostmaiden.\" This paranoia can be ended on a creature by any spell that removes a curse.

If one or more characters come within 5 feet of the ghost, it throws back its head to reveal a bare skull with a rictus grin, catching characters by surprise with its Horrifying Visage. Once the ghost's true nature is revealed, the ropes binding it to the figurehead fade away as it attacks the nearest character. If the ghost is reduced to 20 hit points or fewer, it tries to possess a character on its next turn. A possessed host will attempt to leave the Town Hall by the northern exit and drown itself in Lac Dinneshere by walking out onto the ice until it breaks, attacking anyone who gets in its way.</p><p>If the ghost is reduced to 0 hit points, it fades away with a scream as the White Lady's spirit is forced back to the lake, where it remains thereafter.</p><p></p><div class=\"float-clear\"></div><div><div class=\"rd__wrp-image relative\">\n\t\t\t<a href=\"https://5etools-mirror-1.github.io/img/adventure/IDRotF/057-01-028.png\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" title=\"Bound to a demonic figurehead is a haunting figure, but not all is what it seems\">\n\t\t\t\t<img class=\"rd__image\" src=\"https://5etools-mirror-1.github.io/img/adventure/IDRotF/057-01-028.png\" />\n\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t</div><div class=\"rd__image-title\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rd__image-title-inner \">Bound to a demonic figurehead is a haunting figure, but not all is what it seems</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</div></div><p></p></div></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><h3 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"336\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">T7.

As honey is the key ingredient in mead, the town literally buzzes with the droning of bees.</p><p> Every tavern in Icewind Dale is accustomed to receiving regular mead deliveries, and the town can't produce or deliver its mead fast enough.

It will take a week or two for the town to plan an election. One candidate is a red-bearded shield dwarf logger named Shandar Froth, and the other is Olivessa Untapoor, a middle-aged woman who descends from the town's Chultan founders and who makes casks to hold Good Mead's famous brew.</p><p> Shandar is wanted by the authorities in Mirabar for the murder of another dwarf. Zhentarim agents located Shandar a few years back and are blackmailing him into serving as their eyes and ears in town. Once a month, Shandar travels to Targos to brief Naerth Maxildanarr, its speaker, on everything that has transpired of late in Good Mead.</p><p> Olivessa doesn't want to be town speaker, but her friends are pushing her to assume the role for the good of the town. She would be delighted to see someone else step up to challenge Shandar for the speakership.</p><p> For more information on Olivessa and Shandar, see the \"New Town Speaker\".</p><div class=\"float-clear\"></div></div></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><h2 class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"360\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Shrine of the Flaming Sword</span></h2> <p><i>Shrine of Tempus (god of war)</i></p><p>This vacant building stands on the lakeshore and has a crow-haunted steeple protruding from its peak.

The body is that of Speaker Kendrick Rielsbarrow, a giant of a man in his forties. He died from three stab wounds to the chest. </p><p> The shrine was built over a century ago, when the town's rivalry with Dougan's Hole raged so fiercely that the lake, a frequent battlefield, became known as Redwaters. For a time thereafter, nearly all residents of Good Mead paid homage to Tempus. Today, the shrine's relevance has dwindled to the point where it's mainly used just for town gatherings.</p></div></div><hr class=\"rd__hr rd__hr--section\" /><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--0\"><h1 class=\"rd__h rd__h--0\" data-title-index=\"361\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">The Mead Must Flow</span></h1> <p>Taverns throughout Ten-Towns depend on deliveries of honey mead to satisfy their customers, and Good Mead needs the coin. Two days ago, a verbeeg (see <a href=\"https://5etools-mirror-1.github.io/adventure.html#IDRotF,21\">appendix C</a>) stole three casks of mead as they were being loaded onto a dogsled. When the town speaker tried to prevent the theft, the verbeeg killed him.

To complicate matters, the verbeeg's romantic interest—another verbeeg—arrives as the characters are leaving.</p><p> How the characters learn of the town's travails depends on whether the adventure began in Good Mead or not. If Good Mead is the starting town for the adventure, the characters know all the information in the \"Good Mead\" section, which you can read to the players.

Characters can follow its tracks in the snow without a check. A successful DC 12 Wisdom (@skill[Survival]) check identifies these tracks as belonging to a Large giant.

Once it has the party's attention, it capers atop the snow.</p><p> If the characters rescued the fox from Fef Moryn, the animal bolts toward the @creature[chwinga|IDRotF] if it's allowed to do so. The @creature[chwinga|IDRotF] bows before the fox and offers it a frozen berry, which the fox gobbles up. After that, the @creature[chwinga|IDRotF] and the fox become fast friends.

If the characters turn her down, Speaker Huddle sweetens the deal with coin.</p><p>The white moose is an awakened beast that serves Ravisin, the same evil frost druid who awakened the plesiosaurus in Maer Dualdon (see \"Lake Monster\"). This druid has cast @spell[awaken] spells on several beasts, gifting them with human-level intelligence and the ability to speak, and uses them to spy on settlements and terrorize their inhabitants. Ravisin has taken refuge in an elven tomb in the woods and won't rest until the forest is free of loggers. Simply killing the white moose will not solve Lonelywood's problem; to end the threat to Lonelywood and other towns, the characters must stop the druid from awakening more beasts and using them to harm Ten-Towners.</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><h2 class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"400\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Getting the Quest</span></h2> <p>If the characters aren't staying in Nimsy Huddle's attic, they are summoned to the town speaker's home by one of her children—a cheery little halfling named Scoop.

Her house was clearly built for humans, but most of the furniture is sized for halflings, with a few big chairs for visitors of taller stock. Four halfling children scamper from room to room and climb a ladder up to the loft, chasing one another with wooden swords, while a fire crackles in the hearth in Speaker Huddle's cluttered kitchen.</p><p>\"Our loggers are being terrorized by a white moose,\" says Speaker Huddle, \"and the beast has eluded the hunters we've sent to kill it. We depend on the forest for our survival. I wouldn't be a very good town speaker if I let a dumb moose get the better of us. Will you help?\"</p><div class=\"float-clear\"></div></div><p>If the characters demand more than tasty treats as an incentive, Speaker Huddle is willing to pay them 100 gp for the moose's head, though she can be talked up to 125 gp with a successful DC 15 Charisma (@skill[Persuasion]) check. She suggests that the characters can sell the moose's carcass to a local butcher for 10 gp. If the characters want the pot sweetened further, Speaker Huddle says she can offer them Ramshackle (the closed inn) as an investment property, to do with what they will. \"Of course,\" she adds with a smile, \"if our hunters get the moose first, the rewards will be theirs!\"</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><h2 class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"401\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Tracking the Moose</span></h2> <p>To find the white moose, the characters must venture into the forest and search for the beast's tracks in the snow. Any character who spends an hour searching for moose tracks and succeeds on a DC 15 Wisdom (@skill[Survival]) check finds a set of them. If the characters follow these tracks, roll a [[/r d6]]. On a 6, the tracks lead to the elven tomb, where the white moose can be found. On any other roll, the tracks lead to an ordinary moose (use the @creature[giant goat] stat block) that's encountered after [[/r 1d4]] hours. This moose poses no threat if the characters leave it alone. After each encounter with an ordinary moose, the characters can repeat their search for moose tracks and, upon finding some, make another [[/r d6]] roll to determine if the tracks belong to the elusive white moose.</p><p>After every three hours the characters spend in the forest, check for a random encounter using the Lonelywood Forest Encounters table.</p><table class=\"w-100 rd__table  stripe-odd-table\"><caption>Lonelywood Forest Encounters</caption><thead><tr><th class=\"col-2 text-center\" data-rd-isroller=\"true\">[[/r d20]]</th><th class=\"col-10\" data-rd-isroller=\"false\">Encounter</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class=\"col-2 text-center\" data-roll-min=\"1\" data-roll-max=\"10\">1-10</td><td class=\"col-10\">No encounter</td></tr><tr><td class=\"col-2 text-center\" data-roll-min=\"11\" data-roll-max=\"12\">11-12</td><td class=\"col-10\">Banshee</td></tr><tr><td class=\"col-2 text-center\" data-roll-min=\"13\" data-roll-max=\"14\">13-14</td><td class=\"col-10\">Brown bear(s)</td></tr><tr><td class=\"col-2 text-center\" data-roll-min=\"15\" data-roll-max=\"16\">15-16</td><td class=\"col-10\">Chwingas</td></tr><tr><td class=\"col-2 text-center\" data-roll-min=\"17\" data-roll-max=\"18\">17-18</td><td class=\"col-10\">Fox and hare</td></tr><tr><td class=\"col-2 text-center\" data-roll-min=\"19\" data-roll-max=\"20\">19-20</td><td class=\"col-10\">Wolf pack</td></tr></tbody></table><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><h3 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"402\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Banshee</span></h3> <p>This @creature[Lonelywood Banshee|IDRotF|banshee] is the spectral remnant of a female elf warrior who was banished for a selfish, evil act.

As the most senior representative of the Zhentarim in Ten-Towns, Naerth is determined to turn Icewind Dale into a trade hub for the Black Network.

As a result, much of the decor is nearly two hundred years old, reflecting Luskan as it was in the years before its decline. The inn has sturdy walls but rotten floorboards, and drafts come up into the common room from the cellar. The place is also infested with rats, which scurry between the walls at all hours of the night.

Fifty years ago, a mysterious woman in a fur-lined red cloak stopped at the Eastside on her way to Lonelywood. Because the woman was alone and frightened, the innkeepers—a pair of retired adventurers who happened to be Marta's grandparents—tried to console her. The woman gave them a ring as payment for their hospitality. Not long afterward, a howling wind burst into the inn and tossed the woman about like a rag doll. The innkeepers intervened, giving the woman time to escape. The evil wind battered Marta's grandparents unconscious before resuming its hunt.

A reward of 50 gp is offered to anyone who can rid the mine of the pesky dragonlings.</p><p>When the characters investigate, they discover that all is not what it seems. The kobold leader has been possessed by a ghost, and a grell has infiltrated the mine, setting the kobolds on edge. The characters can either try to parley with the kobolds and get them to leave the mine peacefully, or they can rid Ten-Towns of their presence permanently and try to deal with the grell on their own. </p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><h2 class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"471\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">A Minor Issue</span></h2> <p>Darmo Mazlu, a human boy, stands on a box and yells out the latest news to passersby, most of whom ignore him:</p><div class=\"rd__b-special rd__b-inset rd__b-inset--readaloud \"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2-inset rd__h--2-inset-no-name\"><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-special-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></span><p>A boy wrapped in heavy winter clothes shouts the news of the day as people pass by.

No one was killed, but the kobolds are too dangerous for the miners to deal with. He also reveals that a human miner went missing a few days before the kobolds showed up, prompting other miners to fear that a monster must have crawled up from the Underdark. Oarus thinks it's possible that the miner fell down the central shaft, which is deep enough that his body would never be found.</p><p>One piece of information that Oarus fails to mention is that he ordered the town militia to clear out the mine three days ago. The militia refused to deal with the problem for what amounts to political reasons. Senior officers in cahoots with Speaker Naerth Maxildanarr of Targos are determined to oust Masthew as town speaker and replace him with one of their own in a special election.

Storms bring driving hail and sleet that leaves everything coated in a sheath of ice. Snow piles in deep drifts and blocks all trails leading south to warmer lands. The ice cliffs of the Reghed Glacier rise in the east like prison walls, while the snow-capped peaks of the Spine of the World loom to the south.

If the characters take the bet, the contest sparks excitement in taverns across Ten-Towns, leading to all sorts of side-betting.</p><p>The characters' search for the Red Yeti leads to the accidental discovery of the Lost Spire of Netheril.

The furriers and trappers are merely the camp's latest victims, and more disappearances are likely to occur unless the cannibals are dealt with. Aluka gives directions to the camp, but she can't risk an all-out war within her tribe, hence her decision to let Ten-Towns and the characters deal with the problem.</p><p>The Wolf Tribe cannibals have eaten all their sled dogs and their elderly. Even the children have been forced to resort to cannibalism to survive. If the characters act quickly, they can save the life of a lightfoot halfling trapper (@creature[commoner]) named Honeybee Littlebucket, who has managed to stay alive by convincing the Wolf tribesfolk that she can catch snowshoe hares for them to eat.

Duvessa asks the characters to question Gant and find out what he knows about Arcane Brotherhood activity in Ten-Towns, offering a reward of 250 gp if they obtain useful information. She also gives the party a signed letter notifying Gant that, in exchange for his cooperation, Duvessa will petition the Lords' Alliance for a reduction in Gant's sentence. If the characters get nothing out of the prisoner, Duvessa asks them to inform the prison warden that the Arcane Brotherhood might be plotting a jailbreak to free Gant.

If they attack or otherwise disturb Meltharond's corpse, the dragon tries to shake them off. Each creature on the dragon's back when she rises out of the snow must succeed on a DC 22 Dexterity saving throw or fall @condition[prone] in an unoccupied space on the ground within 5 feet of her.

If the beast is a dangerous predator such as a bear, tiger, or wolf, it keeps its distance from the adventuring party so as not to provoke the characters into attacking it. If it is harmed, the awakened beast retreats to a safe distance. If it's cornered and doesn't like its chances of survival, it bargains or pleads for its life. An awakened beast knows its territory well and can point characters to nearby locations of interest, food sources, or safe places to rest in exchange for its safety.</p><p>An awakened beast can be persuaded to help the characters, and perhaps even join the party for a time. Convincing a neutral awakened beast to travel with the party requires an offering of food or shelter accompanied by a successful DC 10 Charisma (@skill[Persuasion]) group check. If the group check succeeds, the beast remains with the party for 24 hours, after which the characters can repeat the group check to extend the duration another 24 hours. An evil awakened beast accepts any offer to join the party (no check required), hoping to gather more information about the characters or lead them into a trap.</p><p>If asked to give its name, the awakened beast either comes up with a name on the fly or adopts a suggested name that it likes.

This includes, but isn't limited to, a song written to honor the chieftain of the Many-Arrows tribe, a drawing of Gruumsh (the orc god of slaughter) killing Corellon (the head of the elven pantheon), or directions to an alternative food source. Characters who speak Orc while conducting the negotiation have advantage on ability checks made to improve the orcs' attitude toward the party, as does a character with the Orc Stone secret who uses the stone to summon an orc spirit. Characters who speak Elvish or Dwarvish during the negotiation have disadvantage on such checks. If a worthy offering is made as part of the negotiation, the DC of ability checks made to improve the orcs' attitude is 15; otherwise, the DC is 20.</p></div></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><h3 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"557\"><span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Perytons</span></h3><p>Two @creature[Peryton||perytons]—a mated pair—have come down from the Spine of the World mountains to hunt.

Most sperm whales live to be seventy years old, but Angajuk has been plying the waters of the Sea of Moving Ice for two hundred years. Throughout its life, the whale has faced its share of trouble, including near-fatal encounters with Auril's roc, which left scars along the whale's pectoral fins and body.</p><p>Angajuk is famous among Ten-Towners. Most people leave it alone, knowing that the whale is the beneficiary of powerful magic, but uncaring hunters see the whale as a source of ambergris, which is a valuable commodity.</p><p>Angajuk was once the companion of a druid named Anga, who cast an @spell[awaken] spell on Angajuk to give the whale sentience and intelligence. Not much is known about Anga, but those who befriend Angajuk can learn about its beloved companion.</p><p>Characters might learn about Angajuk by overhearing a rumor in Ten-Towns (see \"Tall Tales in Ten-Towns\") or by agreeing to help a whale oil merchant (see \"Whale Oil Acquisition\"). Angajuk is one of the safest ways to get to Auril's island, because the sperm whale can travel beneath the water's surface, avoiding Auril's spies. When the whale is submerged, a magic bubble surrounds the boat to protect those riding in it.</p><p>Angajuk periodically visits an anchorage off the coastline, a rocky arch formed by the action of tidal waters, and can be summoned there by ringing a bell attached to the pier. Thick ice covers this rock formation, extending all the way to the shore. On the shore nearby is Anga's old stone cabin, which has weathered time's passage.</p><div class=\"rd__wrp-gallery\"><p></p><div class=\"float-clear\"><p></p></div><div class=\"rd__wrp-gallery-image\"><div class=\"rd__wrp-image relative\"><a href=\"https://5etools-mirror-1.github.io/img/adventure/IDRotF/097-map-2.2-angajuks-bell.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" title=\"Map 2.2: angajuk's bell\"><img src=\"https://5etools-mirror-1.github.io/img/adventure/IDRotF/097-map-2.2-angajuks-bell.jpg\" title=\"Map 2.2: angajuk's bell\" /></a></div><div class=\"rd__image-title\"><p></p></div></div><p></p><p></p><div class=\"float-clear\"><p></p></div><div class=\"rd__wrp-gallery-image\"><div class=\"rd__wrp-image relative\"><a href=\"https://5etools-mirror-1.github.io/img/adventure/IDRotF/098-map-2.2-angajuks-bell-player.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" title=\"Player Version\"><img src=\"https://5etools-mirror-1.github.io/img/adventure/IDRotF/098-map-2.2-angajuks-bell-player.jpg\" title=\"Player Version\" /></a></div><div class=\"rd__image-title\"><div class=\"rd__image-title-inner \"><p>Player Version</p></div></div></div><p></p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><h2 class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"565\"><span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Angajuk's Bell Locations</span></h2><p>The following locations are keyed to map 2.2.</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><h3 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"566\"><span class=\"entry-title-inner\">A1. Frozen Pier</span></h3><p>A rowboat is stuck in the ice, trapped against a 10-foot-long wooden pier. The pier is ice-glazed and slippery. The characters don't need the boat, since they can simply walk across the ice to reach Angajuk's Bell (area A3).</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><h3 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"567\"><span class=\"entry-title-inner\">A2. Stone Cabin</span></h3><p>A small, domed cabin faces the bay. A bloated door covered in ice and dormant barnacles hangs slightly ajar on rusted hinges.</p><p>Anga once lived in this small stone cabin near the pier, which made it convenient for her to visit Angajuk. The place has been vacant for decades.</p><p>Thick rime coats every surface and object inside the cabin, including a bed draped in a thick knit blanket. Beside the bed, a small hearth holds a precious store of firewood. The firewood is infested with worms that have eaten away at the tender parts of the wood, but it's safe to burn. There is enough wood to fuel a nightly fire for three days, and it is stored in six bundles that weigh 30 pounds each.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><h3 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"568\"><span class=\"entry-title-inner\">A3. Bell</span></h3><p>A 1-foot-diameter copper bell dangles from a 10-foot-tall wooden pole attached to this short wooden pier. The bell comes with a rope and clapper. Ringing the bell soon attracts three @creature[Giant Vulture||giant vultures], who think that the sound signals mealtime or the presence of prey. They attack unless the characters offer meat to satisfy them.</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><p><span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Angajuk Arrives.</span></p><p>It takes 30 minutes for Angajuk the @creature[sperm whale|IDRotF] (see <a href=\"https://5etools-mirror-1.github.io/adventure.html#IDRotF,21\">appendix C</a>) to arrive after the bell is rung, accompanied by [[/r 1d4]] harmless narwhals or dolphins. Angajuk has an Intelligence of 10 and speaks Common. Its deep, resonant voice carries a slight echo. Once the whale appears, characters must persuade it to be of service (see \"Earning Angajuk's Trust\" below). Otherwise, it submerges and departs after a few minutes. If the whale is befriended and the characters communicate their desired destination to it, Angajuk takes them where they want to go provided the location is on or in the Sea of Moving Ice. The awakened whale knows the location of the Frostmaiden's island and, despite some close encounters with Auril's roc, is willing to travel there.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"><p></p></div><p>Angajuk's boat can hold up to eight Medium creatures and their gear, and up to 1,000 pounds of cargo.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><p><span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Angajuk's Bubble.</span></p><p>To ensure safe transport and to partake in undersea research, Anga designed a boat and strapped it to Angajuk's back. As the whale submerges, a bubble appears around the boat, enabling its passengers to breathe comfortably underwater. Creatures in the boat can exit the bubble whenever they want, but nothing can pass through the bubble from outside it. The bubble is magical but can't be dispelled.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"><p></p></div></div></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><h3 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"571\"><span class=\"entry-title-inner\">A4. Hole in the Ice</span></h3><p>When summoned, Angajuk surfaces through this hole in the ice, expels a gush of seawater from its blowhole, and settles itself at a height that enables people to climb up and into the boat attached to its back.</p></div></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><h2 class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"572\"><span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Earning Angajuk's Trust</span></h2><p>Earning passage on the whale's back requires more than just ringing the bell. Characters must earn Angajuk's trust and can do so in any of the following ways:</p><p><strong>Offering an Octopus</strong>. Angajuk says it would be happy to provide transportation if the characters catch an octopus for it to eat. Octopi can be caught by fishing off the pier, but any hint of light deters them. Use the fishing rules (\"Fishing for Knucklehead Trout\"), only replace the knucklehead trout with an @creature[octopus].</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><p><span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Befriending Its Comrades.</span></p><p>Angajuk lives alongside other sea creatures, including narwhals and dolphins. The characters can lure one of these creatures to the surface with an offering of food (such as a fish) and befriend it with a successful DC 10 Wisdom (@skill[Animal Handling]) check, which pleases Angajuk.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"><p></p></div><ul class=\"rd__list rd__list-hang-notitle\"><li class=\"rd__li \"><p class=\"rd__p-list-item\"><span class=\"bold rd__list-item-name\">Fending Off Hunters.</span> If the characters are having trouble finding another way to earn Angajuk's trust, use the \"Whale Hunt\" encounter below. Defending the whale against these hunters earns its trust.</p></li></ul></div></div></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><h2 class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"574\"><span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Whale Hunt</span></h2><p>This is an optional encounter you can use to help the characters earn Angajuk's trust.</p><p>Hunters from distant Waterdeep have come to the Sea of Moving Ice to harvest ambergris, a precious substance formed in sperm whales' stomachs and typically harvested from a dead whale's remains. Although it smells foul when initially exposed to air, the scent grows sweet over time. As such, ambergris is popular among perfumers as well as mages who use the greasy substance in various arcane rituals. The raw form of ambergris is a waxy lump approximately 2 feet long.</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><h3 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"575\"><span class=\"entry-title-inner\">The Whale Hunters</span></h3><p>Five whale hunters (neutral evil human @creature[Thug||thugs]) were staying at the Black-Bearded Brother, a tavern in Bremen, when they learned about Angajuk's Bell. The hunters arrive shortly after the characters but before the whale's arrival. They wear cold weather clothing and have brought four casks of oil with them. They intend to pour the oil through the hole in the ice, contaminating the water around Angajuk's Bell and poisoning the creatures in it.</p><p>The leader of the hunters, an older gray-haired man named Jendren Uruth, tries to recruit the characters, offering each of them an equal share of \"the take.\" Jendren is not an honest man, but his fight is against Angajuk, not a well-armed party of adventurers. If the characters stand between him and his prey, however, Jendren tries to intimidate them into leaving Angajuk's Bell. Scaring him off requires a successful DC 17 Charisma (@skill[Intimidation]) group check, since he's dead set on getting his ambergris. If the party's group check succeeds, Jendren and his fellow hunters withdraw, only to return 24 hours later.</p><p>If the characters fail to keep the hunters from executing their plan, the oil poisons and muddies the water for 4 days. After a day of contamination, several dead knucklehead trout float to the surface. However, much to the hunters' dismay, the sperm whale avoids the area even after the bell is rung. (For as long as the water is poisoned, Angajuk realizes this and cannot be summoned.) While waiting for the whale, the hunters camp out on the pier or in Anga's cabin. After three more days, they conclude that the poison didn't work and that the whale needs to be lured to the surface with bait. The desperate hunters try to capture a character to use for this purpose and, if successful, bind and lower the character into the water as a lure. Angajuk rises just long enough to fling the lure out of the water, sending the character sprawling across the ice, before submerging and leaving the area, denying the hunters their prize.</p><p>Jendren's death breaks the morale of the other hunters, who head back to Bremen in defeat.</p><p></p><div class=\"float-clear\"><p></p></div><div><div class=\"rd__wrp-image relative\"><a href=\"https://5etools-mirror-1.github.io/img/adventure/IDRotF/099-02-006.angajuk.png\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" title=\"Angajuk takes adventurers on an undersea tour\"><img src=\"https://5etools-mirror-1.github.io/img/adventure/IDRotF/099-02-006.angajuk.png\" title=\"Angajuk takes adventurers on an undersea tour\" /></a></div><div class=\"rd__image-title\"><div class=\"rd__image-title-inner \"><p>Angajuk takes adventurers on an undersea tour</p></div></div></div><p></p></div></div></div><hr class=\"rd__hr rd__hr--section\" /><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--0\"><h1 class=\"rd__h rd__h--0\" data-title-index=\"576\"><span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Black Cabin</span></h1><p>Characters might be drawn to this location by a tale told in Ten-Towns (see the Tall Tales in Ten-Towns table) or by a desire to help a gnome in Bryn Shander (see \"Provisions for Macreadus\"), or they might happen upon the Black Cabin while crossing the open tundra.</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><h2 class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"577\"><span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Secret of the Black Cabin</span></h2><p>The Black Cabin was built by a ranger of the Far North long before the founding of Ten-Towns. When he moved on, the lodge became a refuge for others seeking sanctuary from the wind sweeping down from the Reghed Glacier.</p><p>Six months ago, Macreadus, a sage and devout follower of Lathander (god of the dawn and rebirth), formed a plan to end Auril's everlasting winter. He holed up in the Black Cabin, where he spent all his time assembling a weather-controlling magical device called the <em>Summer Star</em>, using knowledge he gleaned from a book about Netherese artifacts. Macreadus's device was similar in design to a <em>mythallar</em> (see <a href=\"https://5etools-mirror-1.github.io/adventure.html#IDRotF,22,%7b%40item%20ythryn%20mythallar%7cidrotf%7d,0\">appendix D</a>), but much smaller. Unfortunately for him, it had a serious design flaw. When Macreadus tried to use it three days ago, it malfunctioned, incinerating both him and his book. Characters who search the cabin can find the sage's charred skeleton and his deadly creation.</p><p>Since the mishap, Macreadus's restless spirit has lingered in the Border Ethereal, unwilling to depart until its work is complete. (For more information on the Border Ethereal, see the \"<a href=\"https://5etools-mirror-1.github.io/book.html#DMG,2,ethereal%20plane,0\">Ethereal Plane</a>\" section in the <a href=\"https://5etools-mirror-1.github.io/book.html#DMG\">Dungeon Master's Guide</a>.)</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><h3 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"578\"><span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Spirit of Macreadus</span></h3><p>From the Border Ethereal, the restless spirit of Macreadus can observe happenings in and around the cabin, but it can't manifest physically on the Material Plane. Characters can see the restless spirit of Macreadus and interact with it only if they cross over to the Border Ethereal, which is what happens to someone who dies in the cabin (see \"Dying in the Black Cabin\" below).</p><p>In the Border Ethereal, the spirit of Macreadus manifests as a giant, floating, spectral head with fire burning in its eyes. Arrogant in life, Macreadus remains so in death. He's snappy and egotistical, blaming everything but himself for his failure. He welcomes the company of others, but anyone who questions his motives or mocks his invention quickly loses his favor. He spent months locked away in the cabin, building the <em>Summer Star</em> so he could end the Everlasting Rime, becoming more and more desperate to see it through. He had hoped to make a name for himself and win Lathander's praise—is that so wrong?</p><p>If the characters try to finish his work, Macreadus helps as much as his bodiless form allows. To lay his spirit to rest, the characters must fix his creation's design flaw and then activate it, all within the confines of the Black Cabin, where Macreadus can observe the results. Once he sees the device working as intended, his spirit departs to the afterlife.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><h3 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"579\"><span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Dying in the Black Cabin</span></h3><p>If a creature with an Intelligence of 3 or higher dies inside the Black Cabin, its spirit (if it has one) leaves its body and assumes a spectral form on the Border Ethereal until the creature is brought back from the dead. This is what happened to Macreadus, and the same fate awaits characters who perish in the cabin.</p><p>If a character dies in the cabin and its spirit manifests in the Border Ethereal, the player can choose the form the spirit takes. It might look like a spectral image of the dead character, or it might be something bizarre like a ghostly crow or a blob of ectoplasmic energy.</p><p>Regardless of the form it takes, the spirit is not a creature and can't be harmed or turned. It can't make attack rolls and doesn't make saving throws, and conditions don't apply to it. It can't cast spells or attune to magic items. Creatures on the Material Plane can't see the spirit without some ability or magic that lets them gaze into the Border Ethereal. A spirit in the Border Ethereal can't speak to creatures on the Material Plane, or vice versa.</p><p>The spirit can do the following and nothing else:</p><ul class=\"rd__list\"><li class=\"rd__li \">The spirit can move through the Border Ethereal. It has a flying speed of 30 feet, and it can hover. It can pass through solid surfaces that are visible on the Material Plane to explore closed-off parts of the cabin; it is bound to the cabin, however, and can't move more than 30 feet away from it.</li><li class=\"rd__li \">The spirit can make ability checks based on Dexterity, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma only. It applies no modifiers to these checks.</li><li class=\"rd__li \">As an action, the spirit can attempt to exert up to 5 pounds of force on a creature or object no more than 5 feet away from it in the Material Plane, doing so with a successful DC 10 Charisma check. The spirit might use this ability to move a tiny object, write a message on a frosty or sooty surface, operate a simple tool, or tap someone on the shoulder, but the force isn't strong enough to cause harm to a creature.</li><li class=\"rd__li \">The spirit can see other spirits in the Border Ethereal (including the spirit of Macreadus) and speak to them. The spirit knows the languages it knew in life.</li></ul></div></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><h2 class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"580\"><span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Approaching the Cabin</span></h2><div class=\"rd__b-special rd__b-inset rd__b-inset--readaloud \"><p><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-special-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></p><p>Perched on the edge of a snowy ridge above a gorge is a black lodge on wooden stilts.

The building's slumped posture and sagging, snow-covered roof, coupled with the broken windows and loose, flapping shutters, suggest utter abandonment. Large snowdrifts huddle around the rotting stilts and engulf a nearby woodshed and outhouse. Only the wind visits this sinister place.</p><div class=\"float-clear\"><p></p></div></div><p>The Black Cabin has two stone chimneys that rise several feet above its sagging roofline.

Next to the table, on the floor amid several broken wine bottles, is a mostly incinerated skeleton and a round, frost-covered object about six inches in diameter.</p><div class=\"float-clear\"><p></p></div></div><p>The important features of this room are the charred book, the partially incinerated skeleton on the floor, and the round object lying nearby (the <em>Summer Star</em>, described below).

Little remains of his clothing, but a character who sifts through the charred bones and ashes finds an @item[amulet of health] that Macreadus used as a holy symbol. It shows no signs of damage, hinting at its magical nature. The amulet's pendant and chain are made of gold, and the pendant bears the symbol of two hands cupping the sun.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"><p></p></div><p></p><div class=\"float-clear\"><p></p></div><div><div class=\"rd__wrp-image relative\"><a href=\"https://5etools-mirror-1.github.io/img/adventure/IDRotF/102-02-007.summer-star.png\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" title=\"Summer Star\"><img src=\"https://5etools-mirror-1.github.io/img/adventure/IDRotF/102-02-007.summer-star.png\" title=\"Summer Star\" /></a></div><div class=\"rd__image-title\"><div class=\"rd__image-title-inner \"><p>Summer Star</p></div></div></div><p></p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><p><span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Summer Star.</span></p><p>This magic item looks like a 6-inch-diameter gyroscope featuring two scorched rings inlaid with runes and a dense chunk of coal at its core. The Summer Star has lost its luster but not its magic. A @spell[detect magic] spell or similar magic reveals a weak, residual aura of transmutation magic surrounding it.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"><p></p></div><p>The first time a creature picks up the <em>Summer Star</em>, its core glows with a golden radiance as bright as a candle flame. Unless the creature drops the device immediately, the light suddenly blossoms, becoming a 10-foot-radius sphere of incinerating golden radiance centered on the device. Each creature in the sphere must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw, taking 90 ([[/r 10d10 + 35]]) radiant damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. If this effect reduces a creature to 0 hit points and there is damage remaining, the creature is turned to ashes if the remaining damage equals or exceeds its hit point maximum. Once the explosion is triggered, the <em>Summer Star</em> becomes inoperable and safe to handle.</p><p>A character killed by the <em>Summer Star</em> becomes an ethereal spirit bound to the Black Cabin (see \"Dying in the Black Cabin\"). Don't fret if this happens to one or more characters; as spirits, they can figure out a way back to the realm of the living.</p><p>Once the <em>Summer Star</em> discharges its residual magic, the characters—both the material and the ethereal ones—can safely analyze and fix the device so that it functions as Macreadus intended. The steps to be followed are summarized below:</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><p><span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Step 1: Identify the Item.</span></p><p>Any creature or spirit that studies the runes on the device's rings and succeeds on a DC 18 Intelligence (@skill[Arcana]) check ascertains that the device was designed to control the weather. An @spell[identify] spell reveals the same, and Macreadus's spirit can freely divulge this information to other spirits. A character who has Macreadus's blueprints from the laboratory (area B6) can use them to gain advantage on the check.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"><p></p></div></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><p><span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Step 2: Analyze the Problem.</span></p><p>The device has a design flaw, obviously. Macreadus has concluded that the device's rings are unable to contain the magical energy that the core puts out. A third ring must be attached to the device, and this new ring must have runes like those that appear on the other two rings. A character who succeeds on a DC 15 Intelligence (@skill[Insight]) check comes to this conclusion. The check is made with advantage if the character witnessed the device malfunction.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"><p></p></div></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><p><span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Step 3: Fix the Design Flaw.</span></p><p>To craft a third ring, a quarter-pound of metal must be melted down in a fire and recast using smith's tools, then inscribed with runes by someone with a steady hand—that is, a character who succeeds on a DC 15 Dexterity (@skill[Arcana]) check. Using tinker's tools provides advantage on the check. Finally, the device must be modified to accommodate the third ring, using either smith's tools or tinker's tools. The modification process can be completed in a few hours.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"><p></p></div></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><p><span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Step 4: Activate the Item.</span></p><p>A character must attune to the modified Summer Star to use it. While holding the device, the attuned character can use an action to cast the @spell[control weather] spell from it, without the need for the character or the Summer Star to be outdoors. After the spell is cast, the Summer Star ceases to be magical. The spell lasts for the duration or until the character's concentration ends.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"><p></p></div><p>Macreadus knows what must be done to fix the device but can't activate the item because he's dead. If no one can attune to the modified <em>Summer Star</em> because everyone in the party is dead and trapped as a spirit in the Border Ethereal, nothing more can be done with the device until someone else comes along who can attune to it. Fortunately for the characters, they don't have long to wait before someone arrives (see the \"Werebear Visitor\" sidebar). Characters in spirit form can convince the new arrival to do what they cannot, perhaps by writing messages in the snow, or on a section of wall or floor using ash from a nearby fireplace.</p><p>Macreadus's spirit can finally rest after it witnesses the activation of the new and improved <em>Summer Star</em>. As it departs, the party receives a special blessing from Lathander. Any party member who died within the past 24 hours is instantly restored to life at full health, regardless of how the character died. In addition, each character who helped lay Macreadus's spirit to rest gains a <em>blessing of the Morninglord</em> (described below). For rules on blessings, see \"<a href=\"https://5etools-mirror-1.github.io/book.html#DMG,7,supernatural%20gifts,0\">Supernatural Gifts</a>\" in the <a href=\"https://5etools-mirror-1.github.io/book.html#DMG\">Dungeon Master's Guide</a>.</p><div class=\"rd__b-special rd__b-inset \"><p><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-special-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><p><span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Blessing of the Morninglord.</span></p><p>You gain 10 temporary hit points each day at dawn.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"><p></p></div></div><div class=\"float-clear\"><p></p></div></div></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><p><span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Weak Floor.</span></p><p>The section of floor shown on map 2.3 has weakened over time and gives way if 150 pounds or more of weight crosses it. Any creature standing on the floor when it collapses must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature falls to the bottom of the gorge directly below this section of the cabin, taking 49 ([[/r 14d6]]) bludgeoning damage and landing @condition[prone]. On a successful save, the creature grabs hold of the edge of the remaining floor and is hanging from it. The creature can use an action to try to pull itself up, doing so with a successful DC 10 Strength (@skill[Athletics]) check, while another creature within reach can use the @action[Help] action to assist. A hanging creature can repeat the check until it succeeds, but if a check fails by 5 or more, the creature lets go and falls.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"><p></p></div></div></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><h3 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"595\"><span class=\"entry-title-inner\">B5.

What the gnolls got instead was an unending winter and barely enough nourishment to sustain them.

The ship's cocaptains, Vorryn Q'uuol and Dredavex Sinfiz, are chaotic neutral gnome ceremorphs, which are smaller-than-normal mind flayers spawned from gnome hosts. Their crew consists of three gnome squidlings named Rin, Rix, and Zglarrd. See the \"Mind Flayers\" entry in <a href=\"https://5etools-mirror-1.github.io/adventure.html#IDRotF,21\">appendix C</a> for more information about gnome ceremorphs and squidlings.</p><p>The illithids are stuck unless they can find a @item[psi crystal|IDRotF] (see <a href=\"https://5etools-mirror-1.github.io/adventure.html#IDRotF,22,%7b%40item%20psi%20crystal%7cidrotf%7d,0\">appendix D</a>) to jump-start the ship's propulsion system. Vorryn and Dredavex are expending considerable effort to keep their ship functional and thus cannot conduct the search themselves. They also can't trust the moronic squidlings to accomplish such a delicate task. For these reasons, the gnome ceremorphs need help. They have built a device that can detect the presence of @item[Psi Crystal|IDRotF|psi crystals] in a 5-mile radius but haven't found any. The characters might have harvested a @item[psi crystal|IDRotF] from the gem mine near Termalaine (see \"A Beautiful Mine\"), in which case the gnome ceremorphs would be very interested in acquiring it.</p><p>Complicating matters is the damage done by the crash to the nautiloid's life support system, for once this system shuts down, the illithids are at risk of freezing to death. If the shutdown occurs before they acquire a @item[psi crystal|IDRotF], the gnome ceremorphs' back-up plan is to activate the nautiloid's self-destruct system (see area N7) before abandoning ship and making their way toward Ten-Towns with the gnome squidlings in tow.</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><h3 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"662\"><span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Roleplaying the Gnome Ceremorphs</span></h3><p>Vorryn and Dredavex want to leave Icewind Dale and return to the stars they call home with their squidling brood mates and a couple of interesting new creations or discoveries. They retain their gnomish curiosity and love of tinkering, now blended with the illithids' drive for control and experimentation. They are delighted to meet visitors who are willing to help them acquire a @item[psi crystal|IDRotF] or, failing that, help them and the gnome squidlings infiltrate Ten-Towns. In exchange, the @creature[Gnome Ceremorph|IDRotF|gnome ceremorphs] are willing to part with their laser pistols and the magic items in area N9.</p><p>If the characters want to search for a @item[psi crystal|IDRotF], Dredavex gives them a handheld box that emits a clicking noise while a @item[psi crystal|IDRotF] is within 5 miles of it (see area N5). The ceremorphs tell the characters that @item[Psi Crystal|IDRotF|psi crystals] are most often found in places where mind flayers have lived.</p><p>Unlike most mind flayers, who prefer to communicate using telepathy, Vorryn and Dredavex prefer to speak aloud in Gnomish or Undercommon, with an accent best described as \"gooey.\" Vorryn is persnickety and exasperated most of the time but also has a dry sense of humor. Dredavex is industrious and likes to ease tension by telling crude jokes it has learned from eating goblin brains. If they or any of the gnome squidlings are threatened, the ceremorphs react with deadly intent; otherwise, they shun combat.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><h3 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"663\"><span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Roleplaying the Gnome Squidlings</span></h3><p>The @creature[Gnome Squidling|IDRotF|gnome squidlings] have a blind hunger for brains that often overrides their common sense.

The signal's technology hasn't been perfected yet, such that nontelepathic creatures have been known to pick up the signal as well.

That's a hard lesson for a rock gnome sorcerer to learn.</p><p>Five years ago, before Icewind Dale became the perpetually frozen hellscape it is today, @creature[Spellix Romwod|IDRotF] was traveling through the mountain pass with a small caravan when it was caught in an avalanche. The goblins who triggered the avalanche captured Spellix's mates and dragged them back to their caves in the mountains to be eaten. Spellix, whom the goblins overlooked, followed them and devised a cunning plan to free his companions. Using materials scavenged from the wrecked caravan, he engineered a costume for himself. Disguised as a half-metal goblin, he infiltrated the goblins' lair and did his best to fit in, cleverly using @spell[silent image] spells to hide the imperfections in his disguise. When he was offered a bone to gnaw on, his mechanical goblin mouth malfunctioned and wouldn't stop grinding its teeth. Thus, @creature[Spellix Romwod|IDRotF] came to be known as Yarb-Gnock, which means \"Ever-Gnawing\" in Goblin.</p><p>Spellix was repulsed by the goblins' squalor and took pity on them. Abandoning all concern for his former mates, whom he didn't particularly like anyway, Spellix adopted the name given to him by the goblins and spent the next several months engineering ways to improve their standard of living. Long after the other members of the caravan had been eaten, Yarb-Gnock became the new chief after the previous one choked to death on a mountain goat tongue. By then, Yarb-Gnock had already drawn up plans to build a fortress in the mountains. Karkolohk, the Gnomish word for \"home,\" became the goblin tribe's dream of a better future.</p><p>As the goblins were finishing construction of their new home, everlasting winter descended upon Icewind Dale. Fewer caravans made their way through the mountain pass, forcing Chief Yarb-Gnock to send goblin wagons far and wide in search of food and resources. Despite his best efforts, the gnome-in-goblin's-clothing could sense that the tribe was becoming increasingly frustrated. The goblins felt like they were working harder for less, and a few are beginning to suspect that Chief Yarb-Gnock is a fraud.</p><p>Cooped up in the cold with creatures that would kill him if they learned the truth, Chief Yarb-Gnock is running out of ideas to keep the goblins motivated on other tasks and has begun to fear that the goblins are on to him. His costume is beginning to come apart, and paranoia has made him sleep-deprived. The number of \"traitors\" hurled from the mountaintop increases with every cycle of the moon, and the goblins don't know who among them are Yarb-Gnock's loyal spies. Mistrust has infected every nook and cranny of Karkolohk.</p><p>@creature[Spellix Romwod|IDRotF] was beginning to think that the time had come to abandon his goblin kin and seek refuge in Ten-Towns when, two days ago, his fortunes improved suddenly. Goblins out scavenging in a wagon stumbled across a curious object in the tundra—a metallic, egg-shaped crate. (This object was jettisoned from an illithid nautiloid soon before it crashed in the mountains to the east, as described in \"Id Ascendant\"), Chief Yarb-Gnock thinks the crate might hold something wondrous, and getting it open has become his new obsession.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><h2 class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"712\"><span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Karkolohk Overview</span></h2><p>The goblins of Karkolohk often haunt the trail that connects Ten-Towns to other settlements farther south, though it sees little traffic nowadays. Prisoners are kept in dangling cages until they freeze to death, whereupon the goblins cook and eat them.</p><p>Deep tracks left by goblin wagons lead to and from Karkolohk, making it easy to find despite the heavy snowfall. Once the characters are within the foothills and travel high enough to breach the clouds, the fortress becomes visible about from a mile away.</p><p>The fortress is worked into the spur of a mountain slope in a way that uses the natural environment to its advantage. Situated at the top of a hill, goblin lookouts have an excellent view of anyone approaching.</p><p>The weather in the mountains is so violent that Karkolohk's structures occasionally come loose and crash down the mountainside. Other times, chemistry experiments gone awry send wooden structures up in flames. Thus, the fort is always bustling with construction and repairs.</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><h3 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"713\"><span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Goblin Mindset</span></h3><p>Chief Yarb-Gnock has taught the goblins to seize their destiny and stop at nothing to get what they want. Opportunistic creatures that they are, they take any sign of weakness as an opening to gain an advantage. If bullying and intimidation don't work, the goblins use more underhanded and passive-aggressive tactics. If they think that they are at a disadvantage or that they will come to an unavoidable loss, the goblins will do whatever they can to backtrack out of such a situation, be it through bribery, wheedling, or treachery.</p><p>Visitors are not welcome at Karkolohk. Moreover, the goblins who live here detest non-goblins, especially gnomes. Were the goblins just a little smarter, they would see through Chief Yarb-Gnock's crude disguise and the magic he uses to hides its imperfections, and tear @creature[Spellix Romwod|IDRotF] limb from limb.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><h3 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"714\"><span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Gnome Diplomacy</span></h3><p>If you decide to use the \"Peace Out\" quest (see \"Peace Out\"), the characters are treated as diplomats by the goblins and permitted to approach and enter the fortress unmolested, provided they do no harm to its inhabitants. Assuming they avoid a violent altercation, the characters are escorted by a @creature[goblin] to Yarb-Gnock's dining hall (area K11) for a private feast with the chief. This feast consists of a cooked mountain goat. What happens next depends on Yarb-Gnock's goal, which can be one of the following:</p><ul class=\"rd__list\"><li class=\"rd__li \">If Yarb-Gnock's goal is to make peace with Ten-Towns, he gives the party a rolled-up strip of rabbit hide at the end of the meal. On this strip of hide he has written a brief, formal notice in Common addressed to the Council of Speakers of Ten-Towns. It asserts that the goblins of Karkolohk will refrain from attacking travelers and caravans heading to and from Ten-Towns for as long as the peace treaty between Ten-Towns and Karkolohk lasts, and it bears Yarb-Gnock's signature at the bottom. After handing them the message, Yarb-Gnock urges the characters to leave at once and deliver it to the Council Hall in Bryn Shander.</li><li class=\"rd__li \">If Yarb-Gnock's goal is to flee Karkolohk, the meal concludes with Yarb-Gnock requesting that the characters escort him to the Council Hall in Bryn Shander. Mistaking any attempt by Yarb-Gnock to leave Karkolohk as an abduction orchestrated by the characters, the goblins attack the characters as they try to flee the fortress with Yarb-Gnock in tow. During this escape attempt, Yarb-Gnock fights only in self-defense, counting on the characters to deal with any goblins that get in the way.</li></ul><div class=\"rd__wrp-gallery\"><p></p><div class=\"float-clear\"><p></p></div><div class=\"rd__wrp-gallery-image\"><div class=\"rd__wrp-image relative\"><a href=\"https://5etools-mirror-1.github.io/img/adventure/IDRotF/128-map-2.9-karkolohk.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" title=\"Map 2.9: karkolohk\"><img src=\"https://5etools-mirror-1.github.io/img/adventure/IDRotF/128-map-2.9-karkolohk.jpg\" title=\"Map 2.9: karkolohk\" /></a></div><div class=\"rd__image-title\"><p></p></div></div><p></p><p></p><div class=\"float-clear\"><p></p></div><div class=\"rd__wrp-gallery-image\"><div class=\"rd__wrp-image relative\"><a href=\"https://5etools-mirror-1.github.io/img/adventure/IDRotF/129-map-2.9-karkolohk-player.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" title=\"Player Version\"><img src=\"https://5etools-mirror-1.github.io/img/adventure/IDRotF/129-map-2.9-karkolohk-player.jpg\" title=\"Player Version\" /></a></div><div class=\"rd__image-title\"><div class=\"rd__image-title-inner \"><p>Player Version</p></div></div></div><p></p></div></div></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><h2 class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"715\"><span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Karkolohk Locations (K1-K7)</span></h2><p>The following locations are keyed to map 2.9.</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><h3 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"716\"><span class=\"entry-title-inner\">K1.

One of the cages twirls on its heavy iron chain as a flurry of black-feathered ravens tear into the flesh of the desolate creature caged within. Underneath the bridge is a worg with a rider on its back. The rider, swathed in cold weather clothing, appears to be a rather fat goblin. North and west of the higher bridge, resting in the snow, are three large, wooden cages, currently empty.</p><div class=\"float-clear\"><p></p></div></div><p>The wooden cages were built to hold the polar bears that pull the goblins' wagons.</p><p>The @creature[goblin] riding the @creature[worg] is Snubsuk, the courtyard warden.

Hanging off it are a pair of empty iron cages, and dangling underneath the tower's raised platform is a nine-foot-tall, golem-like construct with a helm-shaped head. This humanoid contraption is attached to an arrangement of ropes and pulleys that make it look like a giant marionette.</p><div class=\"float-clear\"><p></p></div></div><p>When announcements or rallying cries need to be made, the top of this tower is where Chief Yarb-Gnock stands to address the goblin tribe. No goblins are on it currently, although it sees a fair amount of traffic. A rickety wooden ladder runs from the platform to the ground. The underside of the platform is rigged with a system of ropes and pulleys that the goblins can use to hoist up anything heavier than a goblin, and the top of the platform has snow-covered hatches built into it that can be lifted away to get at the rigging underneath.</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><p><span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Dangling Construct.</span></p><p>The construct dangling beneath the platform is a @creature[shield guardian] that survived the fall of Ythryn, although its master did not. It was heavily damaged in the crash; consequently, its hit point maximum is reduced to 80. To activate and control the shield guardian, the characters need its amulet, which is inside an ancient tower that broke away when Ythryn came down and crashed in the tundra (see \"Lost Spire of Netheril\"). They also need to operate the goblins' system of pulleys and ropes to lower it to the ground; figuring out how the system works requires a successful DC 15 Intelligence check.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"><p></p></div><p>The shield guardian was built by a Netherese wizard and is nearly two thousand years old. Carved into its massive forearms is the wizard's personal sigil. After the wizard's tower crashed, the guardian left the spire to go find help but got buried in an avalanche. It eventually shut down. Centuries later, a band of goblins dug it out and hauled it back to Karkolohk. Unfortunately for them, the guardian could not be reactivated. After some thought, Chief Yarb-Gnock decided to dangle it from this platform, using ropes and pulleys like puppet strings to make the guardian appear animate and terrifying. This construct must have been a lively sight to behold at one point, but the aura of menace surrounding it quickly faded, and the goblins lost all interest in it.</p></div></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><h3 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"723\"><span class=\"entry-title-inner\">K6.

She also tells fortunes by studying patterns of raven's blood spilled on the snow.

(He can't help himself—he lies about everything.)</p><p>The characters can easily force Spellix to do what they say, since they are clearly mightier than his goblin horde. While in his Yarb-Gnock disguise, Spellix can be used as a hostage to facilitate the characters' escape, or he can command the goblins to stand down and allow the characters to leave the fort unmolested. If Manafek (see area K6) is still alive, she might show up unexpectedly with a goblin posse and expose the impostor, forcing Spellix to put his fate in the characters' hands. If the characters surrender the gnome to the goblins, Spellix is hauled away to take the Walk of Doom (see area K7), and the characters are free to go without further incident.</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><p><span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Egg-Shaped Crate.</span></p><p>Made of magical metal, this indestructible container is 3½ feet tall and 3 feet wide, with a flat base that allows it to stand upright and seams at the top that suggest it opens like a flower.

The panel is a nine-digit keypad locking mechanism, and each glowing button has braille-like bumps on it. Spellix was unable to remove the keypad or crack open the crate, so he has been trying different combinations on the lock.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"><p></p></div><p>The characters won't be able to crack the eight-digit combination quickly, so the easiest way to open the crate is to cast a @spell[knock] spell on it or pay someone in Ten-Towns to cast the spell (see \"Magic in Ten-Towns\").</p><p>Unlocking the crate causes the @creature[gibbering mouther] contained inside it to spill out.

The spire shattered into pieces as it embedded itself in the earth, upside down. There it has remained for centuries, buried under snow and ice.</p><p>The Netherese wizard who lived inside the spire did not survive the crash. The wizard's shield guardian not only survived but also dug its way out, creating a tunnel that others can use to reach the spire's interior. Until recently, the mouth of this tunnel was buried under ice and snow. After exiting the spire, the shield guardian wandered into the Spine of the World, where it shut down and was lost for centuries until a band of goblins found it recently and brought it to their mountain fort (see \"Karkolohk\").</p><p>The characters can learn about the spire in Ten-Towns (see \"Tall Tales in Ten-Towns\"), or they might stumble upon it accidentally while hunting (see \"Hunt for the Red Yeti\"). The NPC who tells the tale is willing to guide the characters to the spire's location for no less than 20 gp. After doing so, the guide wishes the party luck before heading back to Ten-Towns.</p><p>Before the characters face the challenges of the spire, review the information about @creature[Dzaan|IDRotF] in the \"Arcane Brotherhood\" section of <a href=\"https://5etools-mirror-1.github.io/adventure.html#IDRotF,21\">appendix C</a>.

The simulacrum is keen to activate the rune chamber on the lowest level (area P16), because this room's magic can transform an illusory creature or object into a real one (within limits). The @creature[Dzaan's Simulacrum|IDRotF|simulacrum] thinks it can use the rune chamber to turn itself into a flesh-and-blood clone of @creature[Dzaan|IDRotF], but activating the chamber requires a life-spark, which the simulacrum does not possess. Krintaas, who also lacks a life-spark, is impatiently waiting for @creature[Dzaan|IDRotF] to return and quash the simulacrum's efforts to test the rune chamber. Neither the simulacrum nor Krintaas is aware that the real @creature[Dzaan|IDRotF] is dead (see \"Toil and Trouble\").</p><p>When the characters show up, @creature[Dzaan's simulacrum|IDRotF] is ecstatic. Finally, some potentially helpful living creatures have arrived! The simulacrum will bargain, befriend, threaten, or do whatever else it thinks might work in order to get one or more of them to accompany it to the rune chamber. If the characters know that the real @creature[Dzaan|IDRotF] is dead and convey that information to the simulacrum, it becomes even more determined.</p><p>Once it learns that @creature[Dzaan|IDRotF] is dead, Krintaas does whatever it takes to make sure the simulacrum gets the life-spark it needs to activate the rune chamber.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><h2 class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"736\"><span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Approaching the Spire</span></h2><p>When the characters come within sight of the section of the spire that's visible on the surface, read:</p><div class=\"rd__b-special rd__b-inset rd__b-inset--readaloud \"><p><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-special-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></p><p>A twenty-foot-high, irregularly shaped spur of rock juts out of the tundra ahead of you.

Catching the falling flask requires a successful DC 10 Dexterity saving throw. If more than one character succeeds on this save, the one who rolled highest is the one who catches it.

Auril's everlasting winter has made hunting and travel more challenging, to be sure, but the tribes are weathering these difficult times by rationing their food and letting nothing go to waste. If anything, the Frostmaiden's cruelty has hardened the nomads' determination to survive.

They shun Ten-Towns and expect to prevail long after those feeble lights of civilization have been snuffed out.</p><p>A Reghed camp is a somber and subdued place, except for the barking of sled dogs and the sounds of children playing in the snow. The warriors and hunters like to conserve their strength for when it's needed, preferring to spend their idle hours doing as little as possible. Telling familiar stories and inventing new ones that glorify the nomads' outlook on life are common pastimes (see the \"Reghed Stories\" sidebar), as is sharpening weapons.</p><p>Food is critical, of course, and certain beasts of the tundra are staples among the Reghed tribes. Knucklehead trout and seals are often prepared for eating very near the scene of the kill, filleted or chopped and generally eaten raw. @creature[Reindeer|IDRotF] meat, on the other hand, must be cooked before consumption. @creature[Reindeer|IDRotF] also provide the Reghed tribes with sinew, bone, and hide, all of which are used in the manufacture of weapons and armor.</p><div class=\"rd__b-special rd__b-inset \"><h4 class=\"entry-title-inner\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2-inset\" data-title-index=\"782\">Reghed Stories</span></h4><p><span class=\"rd__title-link rd__title-link--inset\">p153</span><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-special-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></p><p>Reghed nomads pass the time by sharing stories that reinforce their values, which are as follows:</p><ul class=\"rd__list\"><li class=\"rd__li \">The tribe is one spirit, always on the move.

Situated on the frigid, misty coast of the Sea of Moving Ice, the prison is a single-story structure topped with battlements. Rising from the core of the panopticon is a tower that holds the prison's administrative offices and guard barracks. Both the prison and the tower are carved out of a tall, blade-shaped rock that rises high above the sea cliffs. This rock, called the Windbreak, shields the tower against the brutal winds that sweep down from the Reghed Glacier.</p><p>One can approach Revel's End by land, sea, or air. A pier allows prisoners to be taken from ships up an elevator to the prison, and a mooring dock at the top of the tower allows prisoners to be delivered by airship as well.</p><p>Revel's End is controlled by the Lords' Alliance, a loose confederation of settlements whose current members include the cities of Baldur's Gate, Mirabar, Neverwinter, Silverymoon, Waterdeep, and Yartar; the towns of Amphail, Daggerford, and Longsaddle; and the dwarven stronghold of Mithral Hall. To be imprisoned in Revel's End, one must have committed a serious crime against one or more members of the alliance and been sentenced to a lengthy period of incarceration (typically a year or more). Moreover, the offender must have political connections that make incarceration in another facility less dependable. Captured spies, for example, are often brought here to cool their heels.</p><p>Each member of the Lords' Alliance assigns one representative to Revel's End, and together they form a parole committee called the Absolution Council. Rarely are all ten council members present, since Revel's End offers little in the way of comfort and amenities. If the council needs a tie-breaking vote to determine whether to commute a prisoner's sentence, the prison warden—a neutral arbiter with no ties to any Lords' Alliance member—casts the deciding vote.</p><p></p><div class=\"float-clear\"><p></p></div><div><div class=\"rd__wrp-image relative\"><a href=\"https://5etools-mirror-1.github.io/img/adventure/IDRotF/137-02-023.revels-end.png\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" title=\"The remote prison of Revel's End contains many of the Sword Coast's most dangerous criminals\"><img src=\"https://5etools-mirror-1.github.io/img/adventure/IDRotF/137-02-023.revels-end.png\" title=\"The remote prison of Revel's End contains many of the Sword Coast's most dangerous criminals\" /></a></div><div class=\"rd__image-title\"><div class=\"rd__image-title-inner \"><p>The remote prison of Revel's End contains many of the Sword Coast's most dangerous criminals</p></div></div></div><p></p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><h2 class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"784\"><span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Involving the Characters</span></h2><p>The characters might be lured to Revel's End by one of the tales or quests at the start of this chapter that have to do with Vaelish Gant (see \"Tall Tales in Ten-Towns\" and \"Behind Bars\"). This villain last appeared in <em>Legacy of the Crystal Shard</em>, a published adventure also set in Icewind Dale. <em>Icewind Dale: Rime of the Frostmaiden</em> presupposes that Vaelish Gant's plot to take over Ten-Towns was thwarted, and that he has been incarcerated at Revel's End for a few years before the start of this story.</p><p>The characters might also come to Revel's End hoping to book passage on a ship, as such vessels are known to bring prisoners and supplies to the prison. A ship can take them to Auril's island (see <a href=\"https://5etools-mirror-1.github.io/adventure.html#IDRotF,15\">chapter 5</a>) or allow them to flee the Far North altogether.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><h2 class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"785\"><span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Prison Features</span></h2><p>The prison, hewn from stone, has 20-foot-high outer walls and flat, 20-foot-high ceilings throughout. Additional information about the prison is summarized below:</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><p><span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Doors and Hatches.</span></p><p>Each door and rooftop hatch is made of reinforced iron held shut by an @spell[arcane lock] spell. Prison personnel can open these doors and hatches normally. A locked door or hatch is too strong to be shouldered or kicked open, but it can be destroyed if it takes enough damage. A door or hatch has AC 19, a damage threshold of 10, 30 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"><p></p></div><ul class=\"rd__list rd__list-hang-notitle\"><li class=\"rd__li \"><p class=\"rd__p-list-item\"><span class=\"bold rd__list-item-name\">Heating.</span> Interior spaces are magically heated.

In some locations, the magical lights can be dimmed or suppressed, as noted in the text.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"><p></p></div></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><p><span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Prison Guards.</span></p><p>The prison has a garrison of 75 guards (use the @creature[veteran] stat block) who work eight-hour shifts. Two-thirds of the garrison is off duty and resting in area R19 at any given time. While on duty, each guard wears a tunic that bears the Lords' Alliance emblem: a gold crown on a red field.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"><p></p></div></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><p><span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Prisoners.</span></p><p>All prisoners in Revel's End are identified by a number. This simple protocol makes it harder for prisoners to identify one another and helps keep them on an equal footing. Prison personnel commit these numbers to memory, and the records of all prisoners—past and present—are stored in area R22. Each inmate wears a uniform that consists of a hoodless robe without pockets, leather slippers without laces, and cloth undergarments. While outside their cells, they wear manacles on their wrists and ankles.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"><p></p></div></div></div></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><h2 class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"790\"><span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Approaching the Prison</span></h2><p>Use the following boxed text to describe what characters see as they approach the prison by land, sea, or air:</p><div class=\"rd__b-special rd__b-inset rd__b-inset--readaloud \"><p><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-special-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></p><p>Perched on a high cliff overlooking the Sea of Moving Ice is a bleak stone fortress carved out of a gigantic, blade-shaped rock. A central tower looms above the rest of the fortress, and light leaks from its arrow slits. Four smaller towers rise from the outermost corners of the fortress, and guards can be seen atop them.</p><div class=\"float-clear\"><p></p></div></div><p>Characters approaching from the north can also see the prison's northern entrance at the top of a 160-foot-high cliff with a pier protruding from its base. A giant wooden crane stands nearby, and a wooden scaffold clings to the cliff face.</p><p>Characters approaching from the south can also see the prison's south entrance and the trail that leads up to it.</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><h3 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"791\"><span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Guards on Watch</span></h3><p>The prison has four guard towers (see area R9), and three guards (@creature[Veteran||veterans]) in cold weather clothing are stationed atop each one. If you need to make Wisdom (@skill[Perception]) checks for the guards to determine if they notice something, there's no need to roll separately for each of them. Just make one roll with advantage.</p><p>If the guards on a tower see or hear something out of the ordinary, such as an approaching ship or group of visitors or a monster flying overhead, one guard descends into the tower to alert the rest of the prison while the others stay at their post.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><h3 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"792\"><span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Getting Inside</span></h3><p>Characters who bang on the prison's north or south door are admitted into a 30-foot-long entry corridor, where they are greeted by the three guards (@creature[Veteran||veterans]) stationed in the nearby guard room (area R3). These guards insist on confiscating the characters' weapons. In addition, one guard searches each character for concealed weapons. A character can conceal a dagger or similarly sized weapon from a guard's notice with a successful DC 13 Dexterity (@skill[Sleight of Hand]) check.</p><p>If the characters have sled dogs or pack animals, a guard grants the party access to the stables (area R5), where the animals can be kept safe. Animals aren't allowed in the prison otherwise.</p><p>After relinquishing their weapons and securing their animals, the characters are escorted by one of the guards to the meeting room (area R12), where the warden greets them soon thereafter. The warden (see area R21) tries to find out why the characters are at Revel's End and decides whether to help them or not. If the characters fail to provide a satisfactory reason for their visit, the warden sees that their weapons and animals are returned to them before throwing them out. Legitimate reasons for coming to Revel's End include the following:</p><ul class=\"rd__list\"><li class=\"rd__li \">The characters seek shelter. The warden will grant them temporary accommodations (in area R7) for up to two days and two nights, and the characters receive three meals a day during their stay.</li><li class=\"rd__li \">The characters wish to meet with a prisoner. The warden can facilitate such a meeting by having the prisoner brought to area R12 for questioning. The warden is always present for such meetings.</li></ul></div></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><h2 class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"793\"><span class=\"entry-title-inner\">High Alert</span></h2><p>When a matter of concern is brought to her attention, the warden (see area R21) decides whether to place the prison on high alert. Circumstances that warrant taking such action include a prisoner revolt, an escape, the approach of an unfamiliar ship, a dragon sighting, or an attack.</p><p>By speaking the command word \"maristo,\" the warden—and only the warden—can put the prison on high alert, with the following effects:</p><ul class=\"rd__list\"><li class=\"rd__li \">For 1 minute, the sound of a klaxon blares throughout the prison, and all @spell[continual flame] spells in the prison take on a reddish hue.</li><li class=\"rd__li \">The guards in area R19 don their armor, arm themselves, and move to area R18.

The spirit of Vlax takes control of Warden Marthannis once or twice a day, each time for an hour or two.

Only there can the spirits of Vlax's kin persuade Vlax to join them in the afterlife. The warden refuses to make the journey, however, because she can't bear to lose all contact with Vlax.

He hoped that his work would help the Arcane Brotherhood gain control of the region. A few years ago, shortly after his arrival in Ten-Towns, Gant established a protection racket in Bryn Shander and tried to turn the town against its speaker, Duvessa Shane, with the goal of supplanting her. He also tried to destabilize the economy of Ten-Towns. A party of adventurers thwarted his criminal ventures by capturing him.</p><p>Rather than put Gant to death for his crimes in Icewind Dale, the Council of Speakers in Ten-Towns made a deal with representatives of the Lords' Alliance to have Gant serve a life sentence in Revel's End, so as not to incur the Arcane Brotherhood's wrath. The Council of Speakers did this not realizing that Gant's scheme wasn't sanctioned by the Arcane Brotherhood but rather hatched by Gant himself, who intended to impress his superiors by pulling it off.</p><p>For a long time, Gant held out hope that the Arcane Brotherhood would apply pressure to secure his release, and that the Lords' Alliance would acquiesce to the brotherhood's demands rather than risk an all-out attack on Revel's End. But by now, Gant has been incarcerated long enough to reasonably conclude that no such rescue is forthcoming.

The last time he was at the Hosttower, shortly before his arrival in Ten-Towns a few years ago, Gant overheard his superiors talking about mounting an expedition to Icewind Dale, to search for a lost Netherese city buried under the Reghed Glacier. Gant had different plans for Icewind Dale at the time, but now the characters' visit gives him reason to believe an expedition might finally be under way. Gant shares this information with the characters if they show him the letter from Duvessa Shane (see \"Behind Bars\") or break him out of prison.</p><p>Gant has no information that can help the characters find the lost Netherese city, but he's willing to share what he considers to be common knowledge about the Empire of Netheril:</p><ul class=\"rd__list\"><li class=\"rd__li \">Netheril was a civilization ruled by powerful wizards. It fell more than a thousand years ago.</li><li class=\"rd__li \">The Netherese learned their magic first from the elves, and later from the fabled <em>Nether Scrolls</em>. Netherese magic was far more powerful than present-day magic—so much so that it made even the gods tremble.</li><li class=\"rd__li \">Evil, subterranean creatures known as phaerimm were instrumental in Netheril's fall, but it was hubris that ultimately spelled the empire's doom. Karsus, a Netherese archmage, tried to usurp the power of Mystryl, god of magic. He failed, destroying himself and tearing the Weave in the process. It would be years before anyone could use or control magic again.</li></ul><p>If the characters ask Gant about other members of the Arcane Brotherhood they've met in Icewind Dale (see appendix C), Gant can share what he knows about any of them:</p><ul class=\"rd__list\"><li class=\"rd__li \">About @creature[Avarice|IDRotF], Gant says: \"The tiefling albino?

Six @creature[Griffon||griffons] circling the mountain's peak watch the causeway closely, and their eyesight is sharp enough to pierce the clouds that frequently shroud the mountaintop. If they see unfamiliar figures ascending the causeway, the griffons shriek warnings to the goliaths of Skytower Shelter. The goliaths quickly arm themselves, expecting trouble. If the shelter comes under attack, the griffons join the fray.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><h3 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"835\"><span class=\"entry-title-inner\">S2.

They descend until they're a few hundred feet away but come no closer.</p><p>At the end of the entranceway is a ten-foot-tall barricade made of wood and stone, set with a crude gate made of thick lumber and festooned with metal blades. Gaps in the gate allow you to see an unusually tall figure in hide armor standing ten feet behind it and clutching a greataxe. Beyond this figure is a higher ledge with five equally towering figures standing atop it.</p><div class=\"float-clear\"><p></p></div></div><p>The figure beyond the gate is a @creature[goliath warrior|IDRotF] (see appendix C) named Arn Rockfist Akannathi, the chieftain of Skytower Shelter.

The cat protects Kaniaka but otherwise takes no aggressive actions.</p><p>Kaniaka's hearing is sharp enough to distinguish the heavy footfalls of goliaths from those of smaller folk. She is suspicious of strangers just as other members of her clan are, but at her age, she feels compelled to listen to what they have to say. She would very much like to see an end to the conflict with the Wyrmdoom goliaths—if such a thing is possible.</p><p>Magic can cure Kaniaka's blindness, and she becomes indebted to any character who restores her vision. Kaniaka is the only member of the Akannathi clan who has as much influence in Skytower Shelter as Arn does, and once her sight is restored, she can gently persuade him to listen to reason. With her help, the characters can convince Arn to meet with the chieftain of the Wyrmdoom goliaths, though he insists that any such meeting take place at Skytower Shelter.</p><p>Any conversation with Kaniaka awakens her son, who stumbles out of his bedchamber with greataxe in hand to confront intruders. If the characters have gotten off on the wrong foot with Kaniaka, Harad threatens to punish them for their intrusion, though his sense of honor dictates that he cannot draw first blood. Thus, he tries to goad characters into wounding him first.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><h3 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"839\"><span class=\"entry-title-inner\">S5.

If need be, Rahi can whistle to summon two more @creature[Griffon||griffons] perched on the nearby slopes; these reinforcements arrive on the third round of combat.</p><p>Like the other members of her clan, Rahi is distrusting of strangers and doesn't abide intrusions. A character who offers to help Rahi overcome the youngling's fear of flying can, with a successful DC 18 Charisma (@skill[Persuasion]) check, get Rahi's permission to approach the youngling. That character can then attempt a DC 15 Wisdom (@skill[Animal Handling]) check to calm it. On a failed check, the youngling tries to nip the character with its beak, and Rahi sends the character away. On a successful check, Rahi is impressed as the baby griffon warms to the character.</p><p>If the party earns Rahi's trust and friendship, she might approach a goliath member of the party and offer to teach that character how to tame a griffon. Given the time commitment necessary, this activity is most likely to occur after the adventure concludes or during a lengthy period of downtime (see the \"Griffon Taming\" sidebar below).</p><div class=\"rd__b-special rd__b-inset \"><h4 class=\"entry-title-inner\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2-inset\" data-title-index=\"842\">Griffon Taming</span></h4><p><span class=\"rd__title-link rd__title-link--inset\">p163</span><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-special-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></p><p>Goliaths of the Akannathi clan can learn to raise and tame griffons using secrets passed down through the generations.

The griffons are taught to respond to goliath whistles and never stray too far from their masters.</p><p>A goliath character who earns Rahi's respect can be taught the secrets of griffon taming over a period of 1 year, during which time the character is entrusted to watch over and protect a single griffon egg and, when it hatches, the emergent griffon youngling. At the end of the year, if the griffon is still alive, the character must make a DC 15 Wisdom (@skill[Animal Handling]) check, with advantage if the character accepts Rahi's guidance. If the check fails, the character is unable to tame the griffon. If the check succeeds, the character tames the griffon and bonds with it for life.

Later carvings focus on wars against the orcs, when the Skytower and Wyrmdoom goliaths were united against a common foe. Carvings made within the past century chronicle the souring of the friendship between the two goliath clans, with scenes showing warriors of Wyrmdoom Crag slaying griffons followed by bloody skirmishes between the goliath clans on mountainsides.

Allow the players time to devise a strategy for ending the impasse. Three possible solutions are presented below:</p><ul class=\"rd__list\"><li class=\"rd__li \">The characters urge the chieftains, for the good of Icewind Dale, to unite against a common foe (such as Auril the Frostmaiden, Arveiaturace the White Wyrm, or @creature[Xardorok Sunblight|IDRotF]). Goliath warriors from both clans, working as allies, might learn to forget the past and forge a brighter future for all goliaths.</li><li class=\"rd__li \">A character who has earned the respect of one or both clans convinces either chieftain that being the first to accept responsibility for a misunderstanding, even when others should share the blame, is a sign of moral strength and good character. Once one chieftain accepts blame, it's easier for the other to do the same.</li><li class=\"rd__li \">The characters keep the chieftains talking—for days, if that's what it takes—by turning it into a contest of endurance. The two chieftains waste hours airing their grievances, then spend longer hours glaring at each other in stubborn silence. (The characters' patience is eventually rewarded when Ogolai has food and tea brought to her. She offers to share her repast with Arn, who begrudgingly accepts out of politeness. This moment marks a turning point as the chieftains agree that there can be no winner to this contest and, more important, that the contest is a metaphor for their pointless, long-standing feud.)</li></ul></div></div></div><hr class=\"rd__hr rd__hr--section\" /><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--0\"><h1 class=\"rd__h rd__h--0\" data-title-index=\"852\"><span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Wyrmdoom Crag</span></h1><p>Wyrmdoom Crag is one of two goliath settlements described in this chapter, the other being Skytower Shelter (see \"Skytower Shelter\").

Members of their family wait for them on the other side, ready to welcome them into adulthood. The visions seen by those who crawl through the tunnel force them to face their fears, experience what it means to be truly alone, and recognize their own weaknesses. Not everyone has the fortitude to make it through the tunnel on the first attempt, but those who fail can try again.</p><p>Visitors who want to experience this trial are warned that it is not for the faint of heart. A character who reaches the tunnel's midpoint must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw and a DC 15 Charisma saving throw. If either save fails, the character is unable to move forward and must withdraw the way they came. If both saves fail, the character is so overwhelmed by visions of terror that they fall into a coma, becoming @condition[unconscious] for [[/r 4d6]] hours.

The speaker would know the characters by reputation, if nothing else.

Xardorok prizes chardalyn more than he loves his sons and his clan, which has alienated his closest advisors and forced them to question their blind obedience to him.</p><p>Prolonged contact with malevolent magic suffusing the chardalyn has made Xardorok extraordinarily paranoid. He keeps his two sons, Durth and Nildar, as far away from him as possible, sending them on dangerous missions to acquire more chardalyn in and around Ten-Towns, fearing that they might usurp his throne otherwise. Xardorok rewards his subjects for spying on one another and uncovering plots against him. The duergar closest to him are aware of the changes in his demeanor, but they lack the courage to stand up to him. A few have learned to capitalize on his paranoia, gaining Xardorok's favor by fabricating evidence of coups orchestrated by their rivals.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><h3 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"875\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">The Muzgardt Conspiracy</span></h3> <p>@creature[Grandolpha Muzgardt|IDRotF], the grand dame of the Muzgardt duergar clan, has recently arrived at the fortress after being invited here by Xardorok. The Muzgardts are based in Gracklstugh, a duergar city in the Underdark. They mass-produce and distribute a filthy duergar ale made from mushrooms. Xardorok has been eager to take a fourth wife and has had his eye on @creature[Grandolpha Muzgardt|IDRotF] for many years. He asked Grandolpha to his fortress to give her a gift—a pseudodragon made of chardalyn (a pseudo-pseudodragon, if you will)—and make her an offer she can't refuse. Once he conquers Icewind Dale, he wants the Muzgardts to control the ale trade throughout his sunless surface kingdom.</p><p>Grandolpha, for her part, is too canny and jaded to fall for Xardorok's blunt attempt at seduction. She has begun plotting with disenfranchised advisors and warriors in his ranks to overthrow him when the moment is right.

Eventually, you get above the clouds and behold a sheer mountain wall rising more than a hundred feet before you. Carved high on the wall are rows of arrow slits with lights burning behind them and clanking sounds issuing from them. A narrow staircase hewn from the rock leads up along one side of the wall.</p><div class=\"float-clear\"></div></div><p>The steps leading up to it are barely 5 feet wide and climb 150 feet to a frost-covered shelf that adjoins the main entrance (area X1).</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><h3 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"879\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Difficult Decision</span></h3> <p>As the characters begin their ascent, read:</p><div class=\"rd__b-special rd__b-inset rd__b-inset--readaloud \"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2-inset rd__h--2-inset-no-name\"><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-special-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></span><p>From high above comes a loud grinding noise as large sheets of ice break off the fortress walls and tumble down the mountainside. Suddenly, great doors of ice previously hidden under snow stand open more than three hundred feet above you, and from between them flies a huge dragon made of dark ice. Its eyes glow with a bright golden light as it lets out a terrible roar, hurls itself into the air, and glides away from the fortress, then turns and heads north toward Ten-Towns.</p><div class=\"float-clear\"></div></div><p>The @creature[chardalyn dragon|IDRotF] (see <a href=\"https://5etools-mirror-1.github.io/adventure.html#IDRotF,21\">appendix C</a>) exits the fortress by climbing up a shaft that leads from the forge level to the fortress's summit. The doors at the top of the shaft remain open until the dragon returns or until someone closes them by using the levers in areasX13 and X15.</p><p>The dragon stays at least 250 feet away from the party and does not pay any attention to the characters as it flies off on its mission to destroy Ten-Towns. Given the dragon's impressive flying speed, it's unlikely that the characters will be able to catch up to it.</p><p>The characters must now make a big decision: do they assault Xardorok's fortress as planned or follow the dragon back to Ten-Towns? If they continue their climb to the fortress, continue with the next section; if they pursue the dragon, move on to <a href=\"https://5etools-mirror-1.github.io/adventure.html#IDRotF,14\">chapter 4</a>.</p></div></div></div><hr class=\"rd__hr rd__hr--section\" /><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--0\"><h1 class=\"rd__h rd__h--0\" data-title-index=\"880\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Xardorok's Fortress</span></h1> <p>The fortress, depicted on map 3.1, has the following noteworthy features:</p><ul class=\"rd__list rd__list-hang-notitle\"><li class=\"rd__li \"><p class=\"rd__p-list-item\"><span class=\"bold rd__list-item-name\">Bare Stone.</span> Hewn from gray stone, the fortress is bereft of ornamentation or artistic flair.

Seated in the chair facing the door is a haggard old duergar with long black hair streaked with ribbons of white and fingernails like shards of iron. She is devouring a hearty buffet of cooked meats, mushrooms, and strange Underdark fare. Lurking next to her is a small mechanical dragon made of a shiny black substance.</p><p>Hunched over a hot stove in the west side of the room are three duergar cooks. At the sight of you, they drop their utensils and reach for their weapons, but the old duergar says something in Dwarvish that keeps them at bay.</p><div class=\"float-clear\"></div></div><p>Xardorok and his sons dine here, occasionally joined by guests. In attendance today is Xardorok's paramour, @creature[Grandolpha Muzgardt|IDRotF] (see the accompanying stat block). The three @creature[duergar] cooks are Grandolpha's loyal bodyguards. The chardalyn dragonet next to Grandolpha is a gift from Xardorok; it's a lawful evil construct that understands Draconic and Dwarvish but can't speak. It otherwise has the statistics of a @creature[pseudodragon].</p><p>After telling her bodyguards to stand down, Grandolpha invites the characters to join her for dinner. The main course is a cooked intellect devourer, its brain-body stewing in its own juices. The characters can partake of the feast that Grandolpha's guards have prepared, but the food has a thin layer of ash covering it that spoils the taste. Grandolpha doesn't seem to mind, though. She also offers the characters a vile Muzgardt brew made from Underdark mushrooms, which she pours from a jug on the table before her.</p><p>Grandolpha has no stake in Xardorok's plot to conquer Icewind Dale and does nothing to help or hinder his efforts. If the characters threaten her, she laughs at their audacity and refuses to meet their demands. If the characters ask for her help, she shares the following information with them:</p><ul class=\"rd__list\"><li class=\"rd__li \">She doesn't know Xardorok's current whereabouts but assumes he's in the forge (area X24) on the lowest level of the fortress.</li><li class=\"rd__li \">Xardorok has programmed his chardalyn dragon to follow a prearranged flight plan. The characters can view the dragon's route in Xardorok's war room (area X4).</li><li class=\"rd__li \">Xardorok is capturing Underdark monsters, which he plans to unleash upon Icewind Dale. He has also captured a myconid sovereign and is using its spores to reanimate corpses.</li><li class=\"rd__li \">Xardorok has proposed an alliance between his clan and the Muzgardt clan. Grandolpha is entertaining Xardorok's offer but hasn't agreed to anything. The mechanical pseudodragon was a gift from Xardorok, designed to win Grandolpha's affection.</li><li class=\"rd__li \">Given time, Grandolpha thinks she can turn most of the Sunblight duergar against Xardorok. Several of them have already pledged their loyalty to her.</li></ul><p>Before entering combat, Grandolpha casts @spell[stoneskin] on herself. Once her guards come to her rescue, she withdraws from combat and uses her @spell[faerie fire] spell to make enemies easier for her guards to hit. The chardalyn pseudodragon defends Grandolpha to the death.</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"906\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Slaad Host.</span></span> <p>If a character has the Slaad Host secret (see <a href=\"https://5etools-mirror-1.github.io/adventure.html#IDRotF,20\">appendix B</a>) and has a @creature[slaad tadpole] gestating inside them, having the tadpole burst out of the character's chest during dinner would be excellent timing for its shock value. Grandolpha suggests not killing the tadpole and instead proposes that it be allowed to grow into a full-sized slaad. \"Let Xardorok deal with it,\" she says. If the characters allow this to happen, the tadpole slinks away and finds a quiet corner of the fortress in which to grow, becoming a full-grown slaad within [[/r 2d12]] hours.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div><p></p><div class=\"float-clear\"></div><div><div class=\"rd__wrp-image relative\">\n\t\t\t<a href=\"https://5etools-mirror-1.github.io/img/adventure/IDRotF/150-637357081668773609.png\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" title=\"Grandolpha Muzgardt\">\n\t\t\t\t<img class=\"rd__image\" src=\"https://5etools-mirror-1.github.io/img/adventure/IDRotF/150-637357081668773609.png\" />\n\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t</div><div class=\"rd__image-title\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rd__image-title-inner \">@creature[Grandolpha Muzgardt|IDRotF]</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</div></div><p></p></div></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><h3 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"907\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">X9.

His crown and gauntlet are made of chardalyn.</p><p>The clean-up crew consists of the @creature[duergar] forewoman, Thontara, and six @creature[Quaggoth||quaggoths]. Thontara carries a horn that she uses as a loudspeaker; the iron key that unlocks the outer gate (area X23) is hidden inside a compartment in the heel of her left boot.</p><p>Three guards are stationed atop each tower—twelve @creature[duergar] in total.

Pekoe says that the duergar abducted him and asked him a lot of questions about his town's defenses.</p><p>The doppelganger knows the settlements of Ten-Towns well enough to pass for a Ten-Towner. Any character who doubts Pekoe's story can make a Wisdom (@skill[Insight]) check; if the character's check result is higher than the doppelganger's Charisma (@skill[Deception]) check result, the character senses that something is off about Pekoe but can't tell what. The doppelganger tries to acquire some cold weather clothing and remains with the party until it reaches Ten-Towns. Once there, it slips away and adopts a new disguise. The doppelganger won't harm the characters unless they give it reason to.</p><p>The loud banging comes from an unarmed @creature[goliath warrior|IDRotF] named Kapanuk Talltree Thuunlakalaga. After becoming separated from his hunting party during a blizzard, Kapanuk was ambushed by duergar and brought to the fortress for interrogation. Since he knows nothing about Ten-Towns, Kapanuk was of little use to his captors.</p><p>If released, Kapanuk tries to acquire some weapons and armor. He also invites the characters to return with him to Wyrmdoom Crag, where his kin will give them the heroes' feast they deserve.

A pair of hooded duergar prod her with hot iron rods, searing her flesh and causing her to bellow in agony.</p><div class=\"float-clear\"></div></div><p>The unarmed and unarmored @creature[duergar] shackled to the chair is Nefrun, the former captain of the guard. She has 7 hit points remaining. Her torturers are two @creature[Duergar Mind Master|MTF|duergar mind masters] (see <a href=\"https://5etools-mirror-1.github.io/adventure.html#IDRotF,21\">appendix C</a>) wearing black hoods.</p><p>If @creature[Xardorok Sunblight|IDRotF] (see <a href=\"https://5etools-mirror-1.github.io/adventure.html#IDRotF,21\">appendix C</a>) is encountered here, he's overseeing the torture of Nefrun, who has been implicated in a plot to assassinate him. Describe Xardorok as a soot-stained, gray-bearded duergar with a jagged black crown on his brow and a spiky black gauntlet on one hand. His crown and gauntlet are made of chardalyn.</p><p>The mind masters want their prisoner to identify others involved in the coup against Xardorok. Nefrun is refusing to cooperate and is not guilty of the crimes leveled against her. She suspects Klondorn, the high priest of Deep Duerra (see area X31), has turned Xardorok against her. If she is released, Nefrun intends to demonstrate her loyalty to Xardorok. If that means betraying her liberators, Nefrun does so without question. Nefrun's gear, including her armors and weapons, is on the floor next to the chair.</p><p>Xardorok won't fight to the death in this area. Instead, he uses the secret door (see below) to retreat to area X30 and uses the elevator there to make his way toward area X8, where he plans to join forces with @creature[Grandolpha Muzgardt|IDRotF]. Grandolpha goes along with Xardorok but won't aid him in a fight, allowing the characters to kill him. If Xardorok is gravely wounded and Grandolpha can kill him without putting herself in harm's way, she seizes the opportunity.</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"958\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Iron Sarcophagi.</span></span> <p>The closed, upright sarcophagi are iron maidens. The room contains ten of these devices, each one with spikes lining the interior of its lid. A Small or Medium creature shackled inside an iron maiden takes 11 ([[/r 2d10]]) piercing damage when the lid snaps shut. The creature takes this damage again at the start of each of its turns until it is released.

The portcullis can also be raised with a @spell[knock] spell or similar magic.

These barriers fall and lock into place if the characters physically forced open the portcullis that seals the vault's entrance.

Xardorok keeps the combinations for these chests in his quarters (area X5). A character using thieves' tools can spend 1 minute trying to disable the lock, doing so with a successful DC 20 Dexterity check. A @spell[knock] spell or similar magic also opens a chest. Here are the chests' descriptions:</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div><p><b>Chest 1</b> contains a dozen stoppered gourds, each holding a pint of a fiercely hot liquor made from fire lichen, which grows in the Underdark. Each gourd can be sold to a tavernkeeper in Ten-Towns for 10 gp.</p><p><b>Chest 2</b> holds a gold mask shaped like the visage of a male drow (750 gp), lying on a bed of 350 gp.</p><p><b>Chest 3</b> contains a silver chalice shaped in the likeness of a spider and inlaid with eight obsidian eyes (250 gp).</p><p><b>Chest 4</b> holds a bundled-up gray spider-silk robe sewn with darkmantle eyes, wrapped inside which is a @item[wand of web].</p><p><b>Chest 5</b> contains a folded @item[Piwafwi (Cloak of Elvenkind)|OotA|piwafwi]—a dark spider-silk cloak made by drow. This item has the properties of a @item[cloak of elvenkind] but loses its magic if it's exposed to sunlight for 1 hour without interruption.</p><p><b>Chest 6</b> holds an amber headdress set with three large purple pearls (2,500 gp).</p><p><b>Chest 7</b> contains a 2-foot-tall stone statuette of Demogorgon that weighs 50 pounds.

If Xardorok is alive and his forge is intact when the dragon returns, Xardorok begins repairing it. The dragon regains [[/r 1d6]] hit points at the end of each hour of repair work. If Xardorok is slain or the red dragon's heart in the forge is destroyed, the chardalyn dragon can't be repaired.</p><p>After returning to the fortress, the dragon remains there until such time as Xardorok needs it to cause more devastation, and certainly not before Xardorok's duergar scouts have assessed the damage to Ten-Towns.</p><p>Xardorok's demise spells the doom of the Sunblight clan if neither of his sons are alive to take command. If @creature[Grandolpha Muzgardt|IDRotF] outlives Xardorok, she absorbs the remnants of the Sunblight clan into her own and has Xardorok's surviving sons executed. The Muzgardt clan takes over Xardorok's fortress but has no immediate designs against Ten-Towns or Icewind Dale. If the characters were instrumental in helping Grandolpha capture the fortress, she allows them to keep any treasures they found in the fortress but insists that they leave at once.</p><p>If Xardorok and Grandolpha are both still alive when the characters depart the fortress, the division among the two duergar clans continues to deepen, but no immediate effort is made to unseat Xardorok.

Stopping the dragon will be a daunting task for the characters. Fortunately, they won't have to fight it alone.</p><p>From the moment it leaves the fortress, the chardalyn dragon begins to carry out Xardorok's plan to level Ten-Towns one settlement after another. The characters can intervene by successfully predicting where the dragon will strike next and confronting it. The \"Return to Ten-Towns\" section provides characters with a much-needed ally and a swift dogsled ride back to Ten-Towns. The \"Dragon Scourge\" section describes how long it takes for the dragon to reach each town, the defenses each settlement musters against it, and the likely outcome if no help from the characters is forthcoming. The \"Showdown!\" section helps you run an encounter involving the characters and the dragon.

Through the blowing snow come three wooden sleds pulled by canines as big as wolves. The closest driver calls out, \"Can we be of service?\"</p><div class=\"float-clear\"></div></div><p>The figure calling to the party is @creature[Vellynne Harpell|IDRotF] (see appendix C), a wizard of the Arcane Brotherhood. She is cocooned in cold weather clothing, her face all but hidden behind a wool muffler. Her snowy @creature[owl] familiar is perched on her shoulder. Her sled has two @creature[Icewind Kobold Zombie|IDRotF|Icewind kobold zombies] riding on it, their acid-eaten forms visible through gashes in their hide armor. Steering the other two sleds are four @creature[Icewind Kobold|IDRotF|Icewind kobolds], two per sled. (See appendix C for the kobolds' stat blocks.) Each sled is pulled by six strong dogs (use the @creature[wolf] stat block).</p><p>Vellynne was searching in Ten-Towns for a group of adventurers to help her complete a personal mission when she learned about the characters' earlier acts of bravery (as displayed in <a href=\"https://5etools-mirror-1.github.io/adventure.html#IDRotF,1\">chapters 1</a> and <a href=\"https://5etools-mirror-1.github.io/adventure.html#IDRotF,12\">2</a>). She decided to try to catch up to them and earn their friendship. Although the fate of Ten-Towns doesn't concern her, Vellynne hopes the characters will help her obtain @item[The Codicil of White|IDRotF] once they learn to trust her. With this ulterior motive in mind, Vellynne offers the characters her sleds for traveling back to Ten-Towns and can easily be persuaded to help fight the dragon. (\"A wizard worth her weight never passes up a chance to test her magic against the mightiest foes,\" she says brazenly.)</p><p>There's room in the kobolds' sleds to transport the characters and their gear. If the characters insist on steering these sleds, the kobolds fuss about handing over the reins but do so, piling into the cargo beds. If the characters refuse to travel with the kobolds, Vellynne jettisons her little sidekicks without a second thought—the characters are much more valuable to her than the kobolds.</p><p>If the characters aren't sure where to go next, Vellynne suggests that they travel to the place where Ten-Towners are most likely to make their final stand against the dragon: the town of Bryn Shander. (Characters who found and studied Xardorok's attack plan in <a href=\"https://5etools-mirror-1.github.io/adventure.html#IDRotF,13\">chapter 3</a> might have a different idea.) If the characters take Vellynne's advice and head to Bryn Shander, they will be playing into Xardorok's hands. The dragon is saving Bryn Shander for last, because Xardorok knows that refugees from the smaller towns have nowhere else to go but there. Bryn Shander's walls provide no defense against the dragon's attacks from the sky, and the closer Ten-Towners huddle together, the easier it becomes for the dragon to annihilate them.</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><h2 class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"972\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Roleplaying Vellynne</span></h2> <p>Vellynne is a pragmatist who tries to stay one step ahead of her competition, in particular her rivals in the Arcane Brotherhood (of whom she rarely speaks).

Because the dock was scaled for frost giant longships, characters approaching by water must climb to reach the top of it. Those without magic or climbing gear can do so with a successful DC 15 Strength (@skill[Athletics]) check.</p><p>At the back of the dock, giant-sized steps climb to the top of the 50-foot-high cliffs. A 20-foot-wide path made from bricks of ice leads from the dock to the fortress of Grimskalle, as shown on map 5.1.</p><p>An @creature[ice mephit] named Söpo is perched at the top of the ice stairs and is willing to serve as a guide for new arrivals, not out of kindness but to alleviate its boredom. If the characters approach by air, Söpo intercepts them. Characters who speak Aquan or Auran can communicate with Söpo verbally; if there's no one in the party who can understand it, the mephit communicates using gestures as best it can.</p><p>Söpo enjoys watching other creatures suffer. Initially, however, it acts as a guide to earn the characters' trust, pointing out areas where characters might slip on a patch of ice or get bonked on the head by a low-hanging icicle. Vellynne's snowy owl familiar, if it's present, senses the mephit's cruel intent. Söpo and the owl have an instant dislike for one another.</p><p>Söpo tries to get the characters to explore every part of the island by sharing the following information with those who can understand its words:</p><ul class=\"rd__list\"><li class=\"rd__li \">The shipwrecks that surround the island are full of loot waiting to be claimed.</li><li class=\"rd__li \">The last ship to visit the island crashed off the coast of the island's northwest arm.

An abominable yeti called Korgrah lives among them.</li></ul><p>If shooed away, Söpo continues to follow the party but doesn't meddle.

After stealing @creature[Vellynne Harpell|IDRotF]'s @item[professor orb|WDMM], Nass fled to the coast to make her rendezvous with the pirate captain's galleon, the <i>Wicked Eddy</i>. The ship found Auril's island the hard way: by crashing into the ice shelf that runs beneath it. As the vessel took on water, Nass alone swam to shore, only to die of frostbite on a snow-covered bluff overlooking the <i>Wicked Eddy</i>'s sunken hulk.</p><p>Characters who search the northwest arm of the island find Nass's frostbitten corpse and much more:</p><div class=\"rd__b-special rd__b-inset rd__b-inset--readaloud \"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2-inset rd__h--2-inset-no-name\"><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-special-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></span><p>Half-buried in snow near the edge of a bluff is a humanoid corpse clad in cold weather clothing.

A voice rings out. \"Ye gods, I was afraid no one would find us!\" The sound isn't coming from the weasel, but from the orb.</p><div class=\"float-clear\"></div></div><p>If anyone tries to pry the orb from the dead wizard's fingers or otherwise disturbs the remains, @creature[Nass Lantomir's ghost|IDRotF] (see appendix C) appears above the corpse and tries to possess someone on its first turn. If her ghost successfully possesses a party member, Nass tries to turn the characters against Vellynne (if she is present) and join them in their search for @item[The Codicil of White|IDRotF]. If the ghost gets what it wants, it shares the following information, some of which Nass acquired when she was alive with the aid of @item[Spell Scroll||spell scrolls] of @spell[divination] used before her death:</p><ul class=\"rd__list\"><li class=\"rd__li \">The Arcane Brotherhood sent four wizards to find the lost Netherese city of Ythryn, which has lain under the Reghed Glacier for nearly two thousand years.

If it's forced out of a host's body when the body is more than 200 feet from where Nass died, the ghost instantly returns to that spot, regardless of whether the wizard's corpse is still there.</p><p>If the ghost is reduced to 0 hit points, it fades away, only to reappear 24 hours later in the place where Nass died. The ghost is doomed to haunt the island until it acquires @item[The Codicil of White|IDRotF], whereupon it achieves its final rest and ceases to exist.</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"1042\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Weasel Familiar.</span></span> <p>The arctic @creature[weasel] is Zelennor, Nass's fey familiar. @creature[Vellynne Harpell|IDRotF] would recognize it as such.

No mortal hand could create such wondrous works.</p><div class=\"float-clear\"></div></div><p>The Frostmaiden creates these ice sculptures. If the characters damage any of them, two bad things happen.</p><p>First, the Frostmaiden makes her presence known, manifesting nearby as a 7-foot-tall woman made of snow. She cries out, \"Defilers!\" and points a finger at them. Each character who defiled a sculpture must succeed on a DC 20 Constitution saving throw or gain vulnerability to cold damage for the next 24 hours. A character who has resistance or immunity to cold damage automatically succeeds on the saving throw. Because of her weakened state, the Frostmaiden can't create another such manifestation until the next dawn.</p><p>Second, Auril telepathically awakens Korgrah, an @creature[abominable yeti] (see area I5), and commands it to hunt down and kill the party. This yeti's sense of smell is so acute that it can track the characters by scent regardless of where they are on the island.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><h3 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"1045\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">I5.

In the course of this task, Isarr might stumble upon tracks left by the characters but continues his search of the outer tents, then does the same thing with the inner ring of tents, saving the chieftain's tent for last. By this time, if the characters haven't already engaged him, Isarr knows they're around and is looking forward to killing them as well and leaving their corpses as tribute to Malar the Beast Lord. If the characters attack Isarr, any @creature[Giant Vulture||giant vultures] circling overhead join the fight as Isarr's allies.</p><p>To pass the Test of Preservation, the party members must keep Aerix alive so that his family's bloodline is preserved.

Iriolarthas endures as a deteriorating skull that drifts about the necropolis in lonely despair. Wispy symbols of the eight schools of magic form above it and quickly dissipate.</p><p>A demilich is what becomes of a lich that neglects to feed souls into its phylactery, and Iriolarthas's phylactery has been empty for nearly two thousand years, buried under the rubble of Ythryn far from the demilich's reach. Having lost its body and its spellcasting abilities, the demilich holds out hope that other Netherese wizards will come to its rescue, unaware that the Empire of Netheril no longer exists. Though it has been trapped in Ythryn under the ice for centuries, the demilich has a very poor sense of how much time has passed.</p><p>When confronted by new arrivals, the demilich assumes they are rescuers from another Netherese enclave and watches to see what they do. The demilich has no means of communication and can't be contacted telepathically, so it judges new arrivals in silence. Characters who observe Iriolarthas and succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom (@skill[Insight]) check can ascertain that the demilich is watching them closely to see how they react to their surroundings. If the demilich concludes, based on its observations, that the characters are not a rescue team from another Netherese enclave, it tries to destroy them before they can steal any of Ythryn's secrets. The same is true of invasive NPCs such as members of the Arcane Brotherhood. A party can fool the demilich into thinking they belong in Ythryn by succeeding on a DC 13 Charisma (@skill[Deception]) group check. If the group check is successful, Iriolarthas believes the party is what it pretends to be; on a failed group check, the demilich sees through the party's deception and becomes hostile toward the characters. If the demilich thinks that the characters are rescuers, given how they appear and act, it follows them around until something happens to change its mind.</p><p>Although it lacks the means to communicate, the demilich dimly recalls the circumstances that led to its present situation.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><h2 class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"1200\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">The Fall of Ythryn</span></h2> <p>After using the @item[Ythryn mythallar|IDRotF] (see <a href=\"https://5etools-mirror-1.github.io/adventure.html#IDRotF,22,%7b%40item%20ythryn%20mythallar%7cidrotf%7d,0\">appendix D</a>) to lift the enclave of Ythryn into the sky, Iriolarthas and his apprentices traveled to the frozen north in search of relics of Ostoria, a bygone empire of magic-wielding giants that waged war against the dragons forty thousand years earlier. After many fruitless excavations, they found a large stone spindle bearing strange sigils at the bottom of the Sea of Moving Ice and brought it back to Ythryn for study in the fall of −343 DR, the Year of Chilled Marrow. During one of their experiments, something went wrong—a flash of power from the spindle caused the <i>Ythryn</i> <i>mythallar</i> to shut down, which in turn caused the city to fall out of the sky and crash into the ice below.</p><p>The inhabitants of Ythryn had only a few moments to react as the city fell. Iriolarthas conjured a doorway to a magical demiplane and stepped through it just in time. As Ythryn settled into its icy grave, all magic in the city became undone for a brief time, as though something was trying to siphon it all away. The demiplane expelled Iriolarthas in that instant, trapping the lich in Ythryn, and became a living demiplane (see <a href=\"https://5etools-mirror-1.github.io/adventure.html#IDRotF,21\">appendix C</a>). Iriolarthas searched the ruins of the city for his spellbook and his phylactery, recovering only the former. He also found several magical servants in stasis that had survived the devastation, as well as a handful of apprentices who had used their spells in ingenious ways to escape death.</p><p>Some of those inside tried to flee Ythryn, but glacial ice blocked all conventional routes of escape, and attempts to leave by magic were thwarted by a troublesome intercessor: the mysterious spindle in Iriolarthas's citadel was still putting out magical pulses of energy to hinder spellcasting. By the time this disruption stopped some fifty years later, fear and madness had warped the minds of the apprentice mages, transforming them into nothics. Meanwhile, Iriolarthas grew increasingly feeble until, finally, the lich's skeletal body turned to dust.</p><div class=\"rd__b-special rd__b-inset \"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2-inset\" data-title-index=\"1201\"><h4 class=\"entry-title-inner\">Fate of Netheril</h4><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"> <span class=\"rd__title-link rd__title-link--inset\">p232</span><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-special-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></span><p>The Empire of Netheril arose more than five thousand years ago. Those who follow the Dalereckoning calendar would place the date of Netheril's birth at −3859 DR.</p><p>The Netherese legacy began with the discovery of the <i>Nether Scrolls</i>. These long, golden scrolls taught Netherese arcanists how to wield magic beyond their wildest fantasies. It took centuries, but the Netherese who mastered the power of the <i>Nether Scrolls</i> became a ruling class, living on great flying cities or taking refuge in remote, subterranean lairs.</p><p>Despite their great power, the Netherese faced a growing threat. Under the heart of their empire lived spellcasting aberrations called phaerimm. Using their ability to drain magic, the phaerimm began to unravel the Weave, without which Netheril would collapse into ruin. In −339 DR, four years after the fall of Ythryn, the empire's most powerful arcanist, Karsus, attempted to neutralize the phaerimm threat by casting a spell of unparalleled power that would enable him to replace Mystryl as the god of magic, giving him absolute control over the Weave. Mystryl countered Karsus at a key moment during the casting of the spell, a feat she could accomplish only by sacrificing herself and tearing the Weave. Karsus was slain instantly, and for a time thereafter, most of the creatures of the world were either without magic or simply unable to control it.</p><p>Without great magic to keep them aloft, the remaining flying cities of Netheril crashed to the ground, and many arcanists who survived were driven mad. Once magic came back into use, Netherese arcanists could no longer cast their mightiest spells as they had before, forcing them to resort to traditional wizardry. Four hundred years after Karsus cast his spell, the Netherese empire was no more—crushed by its enemies and undone by its own hubris.</p><p>In the Forgotten Realms, Netheril is the definitive lost empire. It rose to unparalleled heights but eventually fell into ruin. If you've ever played a science fiction game that includes the concept of a lost, highly advanced civilization, then you can begin to imagine what ancient Netheril must have been like. Out of this empire came many of the fearsome monsters, bizarre dungeons, and wondrous magic items found in Faerûn today.</p><div class=\"float-clear\"></div></div></div></div><hr class=\"rd__hr rd__hr--section\" /><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--0\"><h1 class=\"rd__h rd__h--0\" data-title-index=\"1202\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Necropolis of Ythryn</span></h1> <p>When the characters arrive at Ythryn, read:</p><div class=\"rd__b-special rd__b-inset rd__b-inset--readaloud \"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2-inset rd__h--2-inset-no-name\"><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-special-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></span><p>The tunnel opens into a vast grotto enclosed by gleaming ice.

The game ends when all of one team's players have been eliminated.</p><p>When the game begins, an iron ball magically appears in a random location on the arena floor roughly equidistant from the two teams.

If the team on offense gets more successes than the team on defense, one player on offense can try either to hurl the ball between the metal tines of an electrified mast, hoping to impart an electrical charge to the ball, or make a ranged weapon attack with the ball against a player on defense.

Leather straps extend from one side of the table, into the air above its surface, and fasten to the other side. The shape suggests that something or someone @condition[invisible] is lashed to the table.</p><div class=\"float-clear\"></div></div><p>Strapped to the table is a @creature[doppelganger] named Xerophon. It has been rendered @condition[invisible] and placed in a state of suspended animation by a @spell[sequester] spell. The spell can be dispelled (DC 17), which renders Xerophon visible and awake. The doppelganger looks like a thin, middle-aged man with a sallow complexion, one blue eye and one green eye, and a streak of silver in his long, jet-black hair. The awake doppelganger can use its action to try to slip free of the table's leather straps, doing so with a successful DC 20 Dexterity check, or a character can use an action to loosen the straps enough for Xerophon to get free.</p><p>Shortly before the fall of Ythryn, Xerophon murdered a Netherese sage in the city, stole his identity, and tried to infiltrate the Spire of Iriolarthas. The doppelganger was caught and imprisoned. The prison warden, a Netherese wizard, was interested in studying the doppelganger and perhaps developing a potion that emulated its shapeshifting ability. The wizard made Xerophon acquiesce to a series of experiments, and in between cast @spell[sequester] spells on the doppelganger as a precaution to keep it from escaping.</p><p>If questioned, Xerophon speaks Loross but switches to Common if no one in the party understands the dead Netherese tongue. The doppelganger plays the part of a low-born Netherese manservant who was sent to the prison by his master, Iriolarthas, for disobedience. Without going into much detail, Xerophon alludes to horrible magical experiments performed on prisoners by the wizard who ran the prison, saying, \"I was afraid I might be next.\"</p><p>Once it realizes the fate that has befallen Ythryn, Xerophon offers to help the characters search the rest of the city, allowing the doppelganger time to use its Read Thoughts ability to glean all the information it can from the characters' minds. After all, it has a lot of catching up to do. The doppelganger has no ill intentions toward the characters but places self-preservation above all else.</p><p>If the characters befriend Xerophon, they learn three facts from the Ythryn Lore table, which Xerophon shares to build trust. The doppelganger also knows that to bypass the force field around the Spire of Iriolarthas, one must perform the eight steps of the Rite of the Arcane Octad outside the spire. The steps of the ritual are hidden inside towers dedicated to the eight arcane schools of magic. Xerophon knows the layout of the city and can lead the party to each of these towers (areas Y4, Y7, Y11, Y18, Y20, Y22, Y24, and Y26).</p></div></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><h3 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"1228\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Y6.

If the characters communicate with her, she greets them warily in Loross (see the \"Loross: The Netherese Tongue\" sidebar) and tries to find out what has happened in the world in the centuries since Ythryn's fall. Her singular goal is to restore Ythryn to its past glory. She doesn't know why the city crashed, but she believes that the broken obelisk (see area Y21) can turn back time to repair the damage. To activate its magic, Veneranda says she needs Iriolarthas's @item[staff of power], which he keeps in his study. She proposes that the characters break into Iriolarthas's study, steal his staff, and bring it to her. She declines to accompany them, on account of the likely danger. If they complete this mission and return with the staff, she escorts them to the obelisk and tries to activate it. If the characters are unwilling to help Veneranda achieve her goal, they quickly outlive their usefulness, and she tries to destroy them.</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"1268\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Ritual of Brain Transfer.</span></span> <p>Veneranda can use the equipment in this chamber to transform one humanoid into a brain in a jar.

One hour after making this announcement, Auril leaves the tower and prowls through the streets in search of the characters. For every hour that passes, there is a [[/r 1d100]] (20 percent) chance that she catches up with them. Only characters who flee the city and return to Icewind Dale are spared her wrath.</p></div></div><hr class=\"rd__hr rd__hr--section\" /><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--0\"><h1 class=\"rd__h rd__h--0\" data-title-index=\"1329\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Summoning the Tarrasque</span></h1> <p>Characters who find the @item[scroll of tarrasque summoning|IDRotF] in the Spire of Iriolarthas might be sorely tempted to use it. @item[Professor Skant|IDRotF], an expert on the tarrasque, warns the characters about the uncontrollable nature of the monster and the danger it represents, but the <i>professor orb</i> also confesses that it would love to observe the tarrasque firsthand.</p><p>If summoned in Ythryn, the @creature[tarrasque] destroys everything in sight before smashing its way through the Caves of Hunger and continuing its rampage across Icewind Dale, inevitably putting Ten-Towns in peril. The mountains to the south, the sea to the north and west, and the towering glacier to the east contain the tarrasque for a while. The extreme cold also makes the creature lethargic. It might take months, but the hungry tarrasque eventually makes its way southward through the mountain pass, imperiling the rest of the Sword Coast, if nothing is done to curtail its rampage.</p><p>If summoned on Auril's island, the tarrasque is trapped there by the deep, churning Sea of Moving Ice. The behemoth lays waste to Grimskalle and everything else on the island before sinking into a deep hibernation.

Some players will want to keep their characters' secrets buried. For the others, work with them to figure out the best way for the characters' secrets to bear fruit. For example, a character who has the Ring Hunter secret might still be searching for the signet ring that secures their inheritance; perhaps the ring is discovered during a celebratory dinner in Ten-Towns, when the character cuts open their pan-fried knucklehead trout and the ring unceremoniously spills out!</p></div><hr class=\"rd__hr rd__hr--section\" /><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--0\"><h1 class=\"rd__h rd__h--0\" data-title-index=\"1332\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Summer Is Coming</span></h1> <p>Slaying Auril or her roc prevents the Frostmaiden from casting her nightly spell, ending her everlasting winter. The characters can also counteract the Frostmaiden's everlasting winter by using the @item[Ythryn mythallar|IDRotF] to effect a change in the weather, though any such attempt inevitably leads to a confrontation with Auril and her faithful. Only by slaying Auril can the characters deprive her followers of their god-granted spells and their will to fight.</p><p>With the Frostmaiden's defeat, normal seasonal weather returns to Icewind Dale. The sun again rises above the horizon, and as temperatures improve, flora and fauna begin to recover. Depending on how they fared against the chardalyn dragon in <a href=\"https://5etools-mirror-1.github.io/adventure.html#IDRotF,14\">chapter 4</a>, the people of Ten-Towns can look forward to warmer times once more.</p><p>Auril's death is temporary, for a god who has mortal worshipers can't truly die. When the Frostmaiden is resurrected on the next winter solstice, she has all her divine power. But her inclination is to retreat from the world and not allow herself to be imperiled by mortals once more. The characters won't have to deal with her again in their lifetimes unless they continue meddling in her followers' affairs.</p><p>The characters can help Ten-Towners rebuild their settlements in the wake of the chardalyn dragon's rampage and the floods. If the dragon has not yet been defeated, finding and destroying it should be a priority. Until its master sends it on another rampage, it lurks inside the forge where it was created (see <a href=\"https://5etools-mirror-1.github.io/adventure.html#IDRotF,13\">chapter 3</a>).</p><p>Characters who help rebuild Ten-Towns might be asked to take up the mantle of speaker in one or more communities, replacing leaders who were killed during the adventure. If he survived, Speaker Naerth Maxildanarr of Targos opposes the characters' political ascendance, since they represent a threat to Zhentarim control of the region; without a power base of his own, however, Naerth can do little to stop them.</p><p></p><div class=\"float-clear\"></div><div><div class=\"rd__wrp-image relative\">\n\t\t\t<a href=\"https://5etools-mirror-1.github.io/img/adventure/IDRotF/191-08-001.end-of-winter.png\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" title=\"The end of winter signals a resurgence of life in Icewind Dale\">\n\t\t\t\t<img class=\"rd__image\" src=\"https://5etools-mirror-1.github.io/img/adventure/IDRotF/191-08-001.end-of-winter.png\" />\n\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t</div><div class=\"rd__image-title\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rd__image-title-inner \">The end of winter signals a resurgence of life in Icewind Dale</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</div></div><p></p></div><hr class=\"rd__hr rd__hr--section\" /><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--0\"><h1 class=\"rd__h rd__h--0\" data-title-index=\"1333\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Winter Everlasting</span></h1> <p>If the characters don't stop Auril, her everlasting winter becomes unendurable to most of Icewind Dale's inhabitants. The hostile climate and the scarcity of food force indigenous creatures to migrate southward or die. As go the @creature[reindeer|IDRotF], so go the Reghed tribesfolk. In time, even the lakes freeze solid, depriving Ten-Towners of the knucklehead trout upon which their survival depends. Within a year or two, Icewind Dale becomes a gods-forsaken wasteland as cold as Stygia. The bitter cold allows Levistus to open portals between Icewind Dale and the sixth layer of the Nine Hells, from which come forth ice devils under the archdevil's command. Knights of the Black Sword who survive to see these events come to pass try to maintain a foothold in the region, though they are opposed by duergar at every turn.</p><p>The ice devils help clear the way for the duergar, who aren't going anywhere unless the characters kill @creature[Xardorok Sunblight|IDRotF] and put an end to his line. Once Ten-Towns is no longer a threat to his supremacy, Xardorok does his utmost to conquer the rest of Icewind Dale. If left unchecked, the duergar become a controlling power in the region. The ice devils, once subservient to Levistus, are dragooned by Asmodeus into helping the duergar turn the Far North into a vassal kingdom secretly under the sway of the Nine Hells.</p></div><hr class=\"rd__hr rd__hr--section\" /><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--0\"><h1 class=\"rd__h rd__h--0\" data-title-index=\"1334\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Year of Chilled Marrow</span></h1> <p>If the characters use Iriolarthas's @item[staff of power] to activate the obelisk in Ythryn, they inadvertently reset the world to a time predating the fall of Ythryn and the end of Netheril. The obelisk has sent them back to the spring of −343 DR, the Year of Chilled Marrow, six months prior to the catastrophe that causes Ythryn's fall and another four years before Netheril's demise. The characters find themselves high in the sky over Icewind Dale. Use the following boxed text to set the scene:</p><div class=\"rd__b-special rd__b-inset rd__b-inset--readaloud \"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2-inset rd__h--2-inset-no-name\"><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-special-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></span><p>The obelisk is gone, leaving an indentation in the ground where it once stood. In its place is an aarakocra with brilliantly colored plumage. Using telepathy, it reaches out to each of you in turn and introduces itself as Necalli. \"I am released from a duty long forgotten,\" it says. \"The world has rolled back more than fifteen hundred years. Now, history can be rewritten.\"</p><p>The city is no longer trapped deep beneath the Reghed Glacier. Instead, it drifts among the clouds, its spires and other structures agleam and undamaged. A skycoach glides overhead, bathing you briefly in its shadow before making its way toward the city's glass-enclosed skydock.</p><p>Weaving between the city's spires are boulevards traversed by tall humans of noble bearing in wizardly robes, many of them accompanied by hairless, green-skinned humanoids that serve as their valets and bodyguards. Some take note of your presence, while others gawk at the empty space where the obelisk once stood.</p><div class=\"float-clear\"></div></div><p>Necalli, a @creature[couatl] shapechanged into the form of an aarakocra, doesn't remember why it was bound to the obelisk or by whom. It knows only that it is free of its obligation to the obelisk's builders. It does its best to convince the characters that the obelisk is gone forever, along with nearly two thousand years of history. Necalli can administer healing to wounded characters, after which it assumes its true form and departs. It takes no action that might harm another creature.</p><p>Ythryn is now a floating, living city under the rule of the @creature[lich] Iriolarthas and his apprentices, the Wizards of the Arcane Star (eight evil @creature[Archmage||archmages]). Almost every other inhabitant of the city is either a Netherese @creature[mage] or a green-skinned magen (described in appendix C). When not partaking in their studies and revels, the Netherese focus their efforts on finding ruins of Ostoria, the ancient empire of giants. It is toward this supreme goal that all of the city's resources are directed.</p><p>The obelisk is gone, erased from history, leaving the characters stranded. They are now stuck in −343 DR. If the characters warn Iriolarthas about the fate that awaits Ythryn and recount the circumstances leading to its fall, the lich takes steps to ensure that history does not repeat itself, including but not limited to keeping Ostorian relics away from the @item[Ythryn mythallar|IDRotF]. In exchange for their information, Iriolarthas gives the characters a skycoach to expedite their departure from the city. Characters who flee rather than allow themselves to be detained can commandeer a skycoach and plot a course away from the city. A skycoach has the statistics of an @item[airship] (see the <a href=\"https://5etools-mirror-1.github.io/book.html#DMG\">Dungeon Master's Guide</a>), but its magic wanes quickly unless it's recharged using magic foreign to the characters. Soon, the skycoach struggles to remain aloft, forcing the characters to set down and salvage what they can from the vessel.</p><p>To put it mildly, the characters have a whole new world to explore. Ten-Towns doesn't exist in this timeline, nor do most of the cities along the Sword Coast that characters might recognize. Many tribes of Reghed nomads prowl Icewind Dale, while Uthgardt tribes descended from Netherese claim vast tracts of untamed land south of the Spine of the World, kept in check by marauding monsters. The Empire of Netheril controls the lush, temperate lands doomed to become the desert of Anauroch. The town of Illusk (still centuries away from becoming Luskan) surrounds the brooding Hosttower of the Arcane. Characters hoping to visit some past version of Waterdeep or Neverwinter find nothing but unsettled land surrounded by the remnants of the elven kingdom of Illefarn. Humans won't begin farming the plateau above Deepwater Harbor (the future site of Waterdeep) or building the settlement of Eigersstor (later renamed Neverwinter) for another three centuries.</p><p>To run a campaign set in this earlier time frame, you will need to delve into earlier products tied to the Forgotten Realms to get the lay of the land circa–343 DR. Of course, once the characters move beyond the strongholds of civilization, the Realms of the past is very much like the Realms of the present—a land of mystery, with old ruins and lost dungeons waiting to be explored. Only now the characters are poised to witness the inevitable fall of Netheril, or find a way to stop it.</p></div></div>"},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{"plutonium":{"source":"IDRotF","entryIds":["6e3","6e4","6e5","6e6","6e7","6e8"]}},"_id":"uQ5OS1ujlDNgD9xl","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":0},{"name":"App. A: Icewind Dale Trinkets","type":"text","text":{"format":1,"content":"<div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--0\"><h1 class=\"rd__h rd__h--0\" data-title-index=\"1335\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Appendix A: Icewind Dale Trinkets</span></h1> <p>@item[Icewind Dale Trinket|IDRotF]</p></div>"},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{"plutonium":{"source":"IDRotF","entryIds":["6e9"]}},"_id":"aaS6dlUjJISMqTgg","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":0},{"name":"App. B: Character Secrets","type":"text","text":{"format":1,"content":"<div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--0\"><h1 class=\"rd__h rd__h--0\" data-title-index=\"1336\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Appendix B: Character Secrets</span></h1> <div class=\"rd__wrp-gallery\"><p></p><div class=\"float-clear\"></div><div class=\"rd__wrp-gallery-image\"><div class=\"rd__wrp-image relative\">\n\t\t\t<a href=\"https://5etools-mirror-1.github.io/img/adventure/IDRotF/193-character-secrets-page-1.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" title=\"Page 1\">\n\t\t\t\t<img class=\"rd__image\" src=\"https://5etools-mirror-1.github.io/img/adventure/IDRotF/193-character-secrets-page-1.jpg\" />\n\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t</div><div class=\"rd__image-title\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rd__image-title-inner \">Page 1</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</div></div><p></p><p></p><div class=\"float-clear\"></div><div class=\"rd__wrp-gallery-image\"><div class=\"rd__wrp-image relative\">\n\t\t\t<a href=\"https://5etools-mirror-1.github.io/img/adventure/IDRotF/194-character-secrets-page-2.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" title=\"Page 2\">\n\t\t\t\t<img class=\"rd__image\" src=\"https://5etools-mirror-1.github.io/img/adventure/IDRotF/194-character-secrets-page-2.jpg\" />\n\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t</div><div class=\"rd__image-title\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rd__image-title-inner \">Page 2</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</div></div><p></p></div><hr class=\"rd__hr rd__hr--section\" /><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--0\"><h1 class=\"rd__h rd__h--0\" data-title-index=\"1337\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Alagondar Scion</span></h1> <p></p><div class=\"float-clear\"></div><div><div class=\"rd__wrp-image relative\">\n\t\t\t<a href=\"https://5etools-mirror-1.github.io/img/adventure/IDRotF/195-AppB-Secret-Alagondar-Scion.png\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">\n\t\t\t\t<img class=\"rd__image\" src=\"https://5etools-mirror-1.github.io/img/adventure/IDRotF/195-AppB-Secret-Alagondar-Scion.png\" />\n\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t</div></div><p></p><p><i>Prerequisite: You must be a human, half-elf, or half-orc to have this secret.

The brotherhood's leadership consists of five renowned archmages who handpick the other members, favoring wizards of great accomplishment. Every year, scores of wizards from across Faerûn flock to the Hosttower of the Arcane, hoping to gain admittance into the prestigious ranks of the brotherhood. Nearly all candidates are dismissed out of hand, without so much as a test, feeding rumors that the brotherhood's leaders are more interested in marketing their own brand of exclusivity than finding new talent. Yet wizards seem willing to debase themselves regardless, for admittance to the brotherhood grants access to the Hosttower's incredible libraries of magical lore.</p><p>The truth behind the brotherhood's ongoing quest for new members is based on the adage, \"Keep your friends close and your enemies closer.\" The brotherhood's leaders seek out wizards who might by their exploits compete with the brotherhood's acquisition and hoarding of arcane lore and magical secrets. By bringing these wizards into the fold, the brotherhood turns potential enemies into colleagues, in effect neutralizing future threats.</p><p>Once welcomed into the brotherhood, wizards are free to pursue their own interests so long as they place the security and sanctity of the Hosttower and the cabal above all else. When not rallying to defend their home, wizards of the Arcane Brotherhood act like friendly and unfriendly rivals to one another, striving to outdo their peers in magic. Open conflict between members is forbidden, yet members are adroit at finding underhanded ways to needle and sabotage one another.</p><p>The Arcane Brotherhood sent three of its members to investigate rumors of a lost Netherese enclave that crashed in Icewind Dale nearly two thousand years ago. A fourth wizard, Nass Lantomir, learned about the expedition and decided to form her own.</p><p>Not long after they arrived in Bryn Shander, the three wizards who had formed the initial expeditionary force parted company, each one determined to be the first to find the enclave—such is the fragile nature of wizardly alliances. The four wizards are described below:</p><p>@creature[Avarice|IDRotF], an albino tiefling evoker with a pair of gargoyle companions</p><p>@creature[Dzaan's Simulacrum|IDRotF|Dzaan], a human illusionist and Red Wizard of Thay who perished recently, but whose simulacrum lives on</p><p>@creature[Nass Lantomir's Ghost|IDRotF|Nass Lantomir], a human diviner who died and now exists as a spellcasting ghost</p><p>@creature[Vellynne Harpell|IDRotF], a human necromancer from a famous family with a cadre of kobolds—some living, others undead</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><h2 class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"1356\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Goliaths</span></h2> <p>At the highest mountain peaks—far above the slopes where trees grow, where the air is thin and the frigid winds howl—dwell the reclusive goliaths. Few other folk can truthfully claim to have seen a goliath, and fewer still to have forged a friendship with one.</p><p>Goliaths love to compete and keep score, counting up their deeds and tallying their accomplishments to compare to what others have done. Goliaths love to win, but they see defeat as an incentive to improve their skills. Above all else, every goliath is driven to outdo their past performance, taking greater and greater risks.

They are people of the wild, as revealed by their tribal names—the Elk, the Tiger, the Wolf, the Bear. They are the tribes of Icewind Dale, proud and strong, bound to ancient traditions that have kept them alive through countless harsh winters. The Reghed wear heavy furs as well as gloves, boots, and masks made of animal hide, to protect themselves from the bitter cold.</p><p>Although they originally descended from humans who were predominantly blue-eyed and fair-haired, the Reghed tribes have assimilated other folk, adding new blood to their dwindling ranks. There used to be more than four Reghed tribes, but the others have all disbanded over the past century, with many of their former members settling in Ten-Towns and abandoning their traditional ways.</p><p>The Reghed tribes rely on a nomadic lifestyle to survive, as they follow herds of @creature[reindeer|IDRotF] along the route of the animals' annual migration. When they make camp, the tribesfolk live in large, round tents made of deerskin and supported by wooden shafts.

The turmoil began shortly after a band of Bear Tribe hunters recovered pieces of chardalyn from the frozen corpses of several dwarves. Oblivious to the demonic magic suffusing the crystal, tribe members used the shards to fashion heads for their spears and axes. Contact with the crystal corrupted these warriors over time, turning them into @creature[Chardalyn Berserker|IDRotF|chardalyn berserkers]. Their cruelty forced the king to banish them from the tribe. These outcasts have since begun raiding Bear Tribe camps for sacrifices, which they offer up to Auril to gain the Frostmaiden's favor.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><h3 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"1368\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">King Gunvald Halraggson</span></h3> <p>The thirty-year-old Bear King cuts an impressive figure and is renowned for his size and strength. He tries to be honorable, but he is often merciless and doesn't change his mind easily. He has trouble relating to Ten-Towners, so he avoids them. His perspective on townsfolk might change if they helped him destroy the chardalyn berserkers who have turned against their own.</p><p>Gunvald has had three wives in six years, each of whom died while she was pregnant. His advisors fear that the gods have cursed Gunvald and the entire tribe. In truth, the king's doting shaman, Ulkora, lusts for him and surreptitiously poisoned his wives. In time, Ulkora hopes Gunvald will turn his loving eye toward her and allow her to bear his true heir. If Gunvald were to learn the truth, he would put Ulkora to death.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><h3 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"1369\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Tribe of the Elk</span></h3> <p>Of the four remaining Reghed tribes, the Tribe of the Elk is the largest and the most tolerant of outsiders. It's also the tribe of the hero Wulfgar, son of Beornegar.</p><p>Members of the Elk Tribe view the people of Ten-Towns as \"tame folk,\" who are ill bred and ill equipped for life in Icewind Dale. The tribe keeps its distance from Ten-Towns to avoid misunderstandings, since the appearance of Elk Tribe hunters near Ten-Towns has been known to panic Ten-Towners who live in constant fear of attack.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><h3 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"1370\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">King Jarund Elkhardt</span></h3> <p>The Elk King is @creature[Jarund Elkhardt|IDRotF], a terse yet thoughtful giant of a man who is nearly fifty years old—ancient by tribal standards. He has led the Elk Tribe for over half his life, and age has made him cautious. He has seen other kings and queens rise and fall, has made war with friends and peace with his enemies, and has led warriors he knew as babes to their deaths in battle. The strain of his long years of rule is etched on his weather-worn face.</p><p>Jarund's late son, Jarund Twice-Born, was killed almost a decade ago while trying to bring down a cave bear, leaving Jarund without an heir. He has failed to produce another child with his wife, Wynneth, and his mistress, Froya, so the future of his royal line remains uncertain.</p><p>Auril's unyielding winter concerns Jarund deeply, and he often turns to his shaman, @creature[Mjenir|IDRotF], for guidance. The king respects the shaman's understanding of gods and spirits, and the fact that both men have lost their sons serves to strengthen the bond between them. @creature[Mjenir|IDRotF] believes that the only way to break Auril's spell is to slay the goddess in her home, but Jarund believes that his warriors aren't strong enough to accomplish that task alone.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><h3 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"1371\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Tribe of the Tiger</span></h3> <p>The Tiger Tribe shuns the stronger Elk Tribe and preys on the weaker Bear and Wolf tribes.

The fearless wife of the late King Korold, she fought alongside him in many battles. After a frost giant's mammoth companion slew Korold, the formidable Bjornhild took his place.</p><p>Bjornhild worships the Frostmaiden and is so ruthless that her enemies believe she has actual ice flowing through her veins. She has no living children that she knows of, but with Auril's blessing, she won't need any heirs to preserve her legacy. Bjornhild intends to live forever by demonstrating her unwavering faith in the Frostmaiden and becoming the Chosen of Auril.</p><p>As if she weren't fearsome enough, Bjornhild has a pet @creature[saber-toothed tiger] named Grava.</p><p></p><div class=\"float-clear\"></div><div><div class=\"rd__wrp-image relative\">\n\t\t\t<a href=\"https://5etools-mirror-1.github.io/img/adventure/IDRotF/250-08-015.bjornhild.png\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" title=\"Queen Bjornhild Solvigsdottir and her saber-toothed tiger, Grava\">\n\t\t\t\t<img class=\"rd__image\" src=\"https://5etools-mirror-1.github.io/img/adventure/IDRotF/250-08-015.bjornhild.png\" />\n\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t</div><div class=\"rd__image-title\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rd__image-title-inner \">Queen @creature[Bjornhild Solvigsdottir|IDRotF] and her saber-toothed tiger, Grava</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</div></div><p></p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><h3 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"1373\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Tribe of the Wolf</span></h3> <p>The Wolf Tribe is the smallest of the four remaining Reghed tribes, and even its most optimistic members don't think it will survive much longer under its current leadership.

He hunts Ten-Towners for sport, bathes in their blood, and strikes fear into the hearts of his enemies. Several members of Isarr's clan have deserted him or been killed off, but the few that remain are fiercely loyal. They believe, incorrectly, that he's the Chosen of Malar.</p><p>Although Isarr calls himself the Wolf King, few others in the Wolf Tribe support him in that claim, but the other Wolf clan chieftains are too weak and disorganized to challenge him.</p></div></div></div>"},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{"plutonium":{"source":"IDRotF","entryIds":["6fc","6fe","740","741","742","74c","74d","755","756","757","75c","75d","75e","768","769","76a","76b","76c","76d","76e","76f","770"]}},"_id":"rcA7dSMi3qOS6rzQ","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":0},{"name":"App. D: Magic","type":"text","text":{"format":1,"content":"<div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--0\"><h1 class=\"rd__h rd__h--0\" data-title-index=\"1375\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Appendix D: Magic</span></h1> <p>This appendix describes the new magic items, spellbooks, and spells found in this adventure.</p><hr class=\"rd__hr rd__hr--section\" /><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--0\"><h1 class=\"rd__h rd__h--0\" data-title-index=\"1376\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Magic Items</span></h1> <p>New magic items found in this adventure are presented below in alphabetical order.</p><ul class=\"rd__list columns-3\"><li class=\"rd__li \">@item[Abracadabrus|IDRotF]</li><li class=\"rd__li \">@item[Cauldron of Plenty|IDRotF]</li><li class=\"rd__li \">@item[Hook of Fisher's Delight|IDRotF]</li><li class=\"rd__li \">@item[Lantern of Tracking|IDRotF]</li><li class=\"rd__li \">@item[Professor Orb|WDMM]</li><li class=\"rd__li \">@item[Professor Skant|IDRotF]</li><li class=\"rd__li \">@item[Psi Crystal|IDRotF]</li><li class=\"rd__li \">@item[Scroll of Tarrasque Summoning|IDRotF]</li><li class=\"rd__li \">@item[Scroll of the Comet|IDRotF]</li><li class=\"rd__li \">@item[Thermal Cube|IDRotF]</li><li class=\"rd__li \">@item[Ythryn Mythallar|IDRotF]</li></ul></div><hr class=\"rd__hr rd__hr--section\" /><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--0\"><h1 class=\"rd__h rd__h--0\" data-title-index=\"1377\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Books</span></h1> <p>Two books are described in this section.

The town's oldest buildings and docks bear carvings of dragons, lions, and goats that pay deference to the family's crest, which featured a chimera.</p><p>Roughly half of Lonelywood's able-bodied residents trawl the lake for knucklehead trout, while most of the others spend their days in the forest felling and hewing the trees that are used to construct boats and buildings. Lonelywood's timber is taken by cart to be sold in other settlements, Termalaine and Targos in particular.</p><p>For as long as Ten-Towns has existed, Lonelywood has attracted the region's shadiest element, from unrepentant thieves to cold-hearted killers. The thick forest looming behind it conceals the dark and sordid dealings that sometimes transpire there. Despite its attraction to criminals and miscreants, Lonelywood is not a place where folk murder each other in the streets. The realities of survival demand that the residents live and work together, and not dwell on history.

The town's logging industry is essential to the growth and survival of Ten-Towns, and Speaker Nimsy Huddle has assured the other speakers that Lonelywood's \"moose problem\" will be dealt with in short order. Hunters have been dispatched to kill the moose, but it has eluded them so far. From what the hunters have seen, their prey is smarter than the average moose, and its white hide makes it hard to spot in the snow. What they don't know is that the moose is using a magic mirror as a scrying device to show it where its enemies are.</p><p>Speaker Huddle tries to seduce the characters with a basket of halfling-shaped cookies, hoping they'll join the hunt for the white moose. If the characters turn her down, Speaker Huddle sweetens the deal with coin.</p><p>The white moose is an awakened beast that serves Ravisin, the same evil frost druid who awakened the plesiosaurus in Maer Dualdon (see \"Lake Monster\"). This druid has cast @Item[bcu9EHHbJ6JfYzHo]{awaken} spells on several beasts, gifting them with human-level intelligence and the ability to speak, and uses them to spy on settlements and terrorize their inhabitants. Ravisin has taken refuge in an elven tomb in the woods and won't rest until the forest is free of loggers. Simply killing the white moose will not solve Lonelywood's problem; to end the threat to Lonelywood and other towns, the characters must stop the druid from awakening more beasts and using them to harm Ten-Towners.</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><p><span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Getting the Quest</span><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></p><p>If the characters aren't staying in Nimsy Huddle's attic, they are summoned to the town speaker's home by one of her children—a cheery little halfling named Scoop.

Four halfling children scamper from room to room and climb a ladder up to the loft, chasing one another with wooden swords, while a fire crackles in the hearth in Speaker Huddle's cluttered kitchen.</p><p>\"Our loggers are being terrorized by a white moose,\" says Speaker Huddle, \"and the beast has eluded the hunters we've sent to kill it.

She suggests that the characters can sell the moose's carcass to a local butcher for 10 gp. If the characters want the pot sweetened further, Speaker Huddle says she can offer them Ramshackle (the closed inn) as an investment property, to do with what they will. \"Of course,\" she adds with a smile, \"if our hunters get the moose first, the rewards will be theirs!\"</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><p><span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Tracking the Moose</span><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></p><p>To find the white moose, the characters must venture into the forest and search for the beast's tracks in the snow.

In the generations since, as other towns have settled into a predictable pattern of existence, Easthaven has continued to grow and reinvent itself. After the Eastway was paved, Easthaven evolved into a frontier traders' paradise, fueling the jealousy of its neighbors.</p><p>Easthaven's founders were thieves from the Duchy of Cape Velen, on a peninsula far to the south. They refused to kowtow to a powerful thieves' guild and were driven out. To this day, Easthaven honors its shady founders by declaring pickpocketing legal within the town limits—which explains the \"Watch thy pouch!\" signs posted in various local establishments.</p><p>Duergar have infiltrated the town of late, scouring Easthaven and the surrounding tundra for chardalyn fragments to bring back to their hidden mountain stronghold. The leader of these duergar is Durth Sunblight, the oldest living son of @Actor[tL8JHA0z9pJcAquS]{Xardorok Sunblight}. Durth and his gang have turned the frozen Easthaven ferry into a temporary base. Using their innate invisibility to move about unseen, the duergar betray their presence only by the footprints they leave in the snow.</p><p>Another occurrence of note is the recent capture of a Red Wizard of Thay who has been found guilty of killing a handful of dale-folk he had hired for an expedition. Speaker Danneth Waylen has issued a decree that the wizard be tied to a stake and burned alive—an event that a lot of Easthaven residents are looking forward to.</p><hr class=\"rd__hr rd__hr--section\" /><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--0\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--0\" data-title-index=\"1137\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Easthaven in a Nutshell</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></span> <p><b>Friendliness</b> ❄❄<b>Services</b> ❄❄❄<b>Comfort</b> ❄❄❄</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"1138\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Available Quest.</span></span> <p>\"Toil and Trouble\".</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div><ul class=\"rd__list rd__list-hang-notitle\"><li class=\"rd__li \"><p class=\"rd__p-list-item\"><span class=\"bold rd__list-item-name\">Population</span> 750.</p></li></ul></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"1139\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Leaders.</span></span> <p>Speaker Danneth Waylen (chaotic good human @Actor[SsRbRXUsnxODzjh5]{commoner}), respected for his humility and forthrightness.

Rinaldo (lawful good strongheart halfling @Actor[SsRbRXUsnxODzjh5]{commoner}), a self-styled bard kept around to entertain guests, is fond of plucking his fiddle while recounting his tale: that the White Lady's husband was a miser who kept his treasure in a heavy, locked chest that never left his side. Perhaps it was this heavy chest, suggests Rinaldo, that capsized his boat and sent the man to his sunken grave, or perhaps it was the fright of seeing his dead wife that caused him to capsize the boat and drown. Either way, Rinaldo is certain that the man's treasure lies at the bottom of the lake, waiting for some intrepid explorer to find it. The inn's sullen, elderly proprietor, Bartaban (neutral good human @Actor[SsRbRXUsnxODzjh5]{commoner}), has heard the halfling's rambling far too often to be humored by it.</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"1150\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Séance.</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></span> <p>Rinaldo is planning to conduct a séance in a back room of the inn and has invited half a dozen other guests (@Actor[SsRbRXUsnxODzjh5]{commoners}) to join him. Characters who spend one or more nights at the inn are invited by Rinaldo to join his séance. If the characters decline, Rinaldo is disappointed and tries to get them to change their minds by saying, \"We live in dark times. Perhaps the spirit of the White Lady can help.

Multicolored lamps and silks are hung from the rafters, and the light from several candles illuminates a circle of uncomfortable-looking guests sitting cross-legged on the floor.</p><p>Rinaldo pushes back the sleeves of his robe, raises his hands, closes his eyes, and intones, \"Lady who watches from the lake, come to us in our darkest hour! Tell us what you've seen!\" After a moment of silence, thick frost forms on the inside of the room's windows, turning them opaque, and the candles go out one by one.</p><div class=\"float-clear\"></div></div><p>Rinaldo senses that the White Lady's spirit is close and urges the characters to reach out to it. Ask the players in turn what their characters say or do.

If the group check fails, the White Lady's spirit manifests as a poltergeist and attacks the party, frightening away the other participants.

The spirit replies truthfully by tracing short, two- to five-word answers on the room's frosted windows. If doing that becomes too cumbersome, the spirit uses Rinaldo as a vessel to whisper the answers. If the spirit doesn't know an answer or thinks a question is foolish, it shatters a window instead. Once it answers three questions, the spirit departs, and Rinaldo can't try to summon it again until he finishes a long rest.</p><p>Here's what the White Lady knows about the recent happenings around Lac Dinneshere:</p><ul class=\"rd__list\"><li class=\"rd__li \">The castle in Caer-Dineval has become a base for a devil-worshiping cult.</li><li class=\"rd__li \">Gray-skinned dwarves have been stalking the streets of Easthaven, Caer-Dineval, and Caer-Konig while @condition[invisible].

Some fishers have gone missing on Lac Dinneshere, and she wants the characters to take a boat and search for them.

To fend off the chill, they often bring bottles of ale to keep warm. Imbibing too much is dangerous, for it makes the anglers more susceptible to being pulled overboard by stubborn knuckleheads. Too much ale also leads to foolhardy decisions. Such was the fate of four old anglers from Easthaven, who abandoned their trusty boat, <i>Bunch o' Knuckleheads</i>, to follow a tantalizing scent emanating from the mouth of a lakeside cave. Inside, they encountered a hag named Maud Chiselbone and a spicy concoction she prepared using her @Item[Xd25hIUCXoquVkyS]{cauldron of plenty}.

Characters who grew up in Icewind Dale have advantage on this check. The figurehead is a Large object with AC 13, a damage threshold of 5, 50 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage.

What they got was hardly worth the effort, and Speaker Waylen doesn't know what else to do with the figurehead except store it here, out of the public eye. He fears the figurehead is tainted by demonic magic and has warned his staff not to touch it. A @Item[9YGzysWMGfMbJhMj]{detect evil and good} spell or similar magic reveals that it's a desecrated object. Any creature that comes into contact with it must succeed on a DC 13 Charisma saving throw or gain the following flaw, which supersedes any conflicting personality trait: \"I suspect most Ten-Towners are members of a secret cult devoted to the Frostmaiden.\" This paranoia can be ended on a creature by any spell that removes a curse.

If one or more characters come within 5 feet of the ghost, it throws back its head to reveal a bare skull with a rictus grin, catching characters by surprise with its Horrifying Visage. Once the ghost's true nature is revealed, the ropes binding it to the figurehead fade away as it attacks the nearest character. If the ghost is reduced to 20 hit points or fewer, it tries to possess a character on its next turn. A possessed host will attempt to leave the Town Hall by the northern exit and drown itself in Lac Dinneshere by walking out onto the ice until it breaks, attacking anyone who gets in its way.</p><p>If the ghost is reduced to 0 hit points, it fades away with a scream as the White Lady's spirit is forced back to the lake, where it remains thereafter.</p><p></p><div class=\"float-clear\"></div><div><div class=\"rd__wrp-image relative\">\n\t\t\t<a href=\"https://5etools-mirror-1.github.io/img/adventure/IDRotF/057-01-028.png\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" title=\"Bound to a demonic figurehead is a haunting figure, but not all is what it seems\">\n\t\t\t\t<img class=\"rd__image\" src=\"https://5etools-mirror-1.github.io/img/adventure/IDRotF/057-01-028.png\" />\n\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t</div><div class=\"rd__image-title\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rd__image-title-inner \">Bound to a demonic figurehead is a haunting figure, but not all is what it seems</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</div></div><p></p></div></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"1190\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">T7.

The days are twilit, the nights dark. As Auril casts her nightly spell, a curtain of light weaves across the starry sky to keep the dawn at bay—an aurora that portends an everlasting winter. Storms bring driving hail and sleet that leaves everything coated in a sheath of ice. Snow piles in deep drifts and blocks all trails leading south to warmer lands. The ice cliffs of the Reghed Glacier rise in the east like prison walls, while the snow-capped peaks of the Spine of the World loom to the south.

Dwarves dig into the earth to seek shelter and mine for iron. Meanwhile, folk descended from foolhardy and treasure-mad immigrants eke out meager lives in Ten-Towns, which can barely hold back the wind, let alone marauding orcs, giants, and fierce tundra yeti.</p>\n<p>Despite the unnatural cold and other dangers, people still brave the journey to reach this harsh winterscape, searching for opportunity and adventure.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"float-clear\"> </div>\n<div>\n<div class=\"rd__wrp-image relative\"><a title=\"The goblin fortress of Karkolohk perches atop a rocky spur in the foothills of the Spine of the World\" href=\"https://5etools-mirror-1.github.io/img/adventure/IDRotF/089-02-000.chapter-splash.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> <img class=\"rd__image\" src=\"https://5etools-mirror-1.github.io/img/adventure/IDRotF/089-02-000.chapter-splash.jpg\" /> </a></div>\n<div class=\"rd__image-title\">\n<div class=\"rd__image-title-inner \">The goblin fortress of Karkolohk perches atop a rocky spur in the foothills of the Spine of the World</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p> </p>\n<hr class=\"rd__hr rd__hr--section\" />\n<div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--0\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--0\" data-title-index=\"1355\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Running This Chapter</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></span>\n<p>This chapter takes the adventure beyond Ten-Towns into the far reaches of Icewind Dale, to places the adventurers might visit as they investigate tall tales or undertake quests.

Helka has 300 gp, which is enough to buy six casks of whale oil and to pay the characters 150 gp for their help getting the casks safely back to Bryn Shander.

Use them as follows:</p>\n<ul class=\"rd__list\">\n<li class=\"rd__li \">Roll the encounter die and consult the <a href=\"https://5etools-mirror-1.github.io/adventure.html#IDRotF,12,random%20wilderness%20encounters,0\">Random Wilderness Encounters table</a> to determine what the characters come across.</li>\n<li class=\"rd__li \">Roll the blizzard die and add 1.

For example, at the two extremes, yetis are always encountered in a blizzard, whereas perytons almost never are.</p>\n<p>Some the random encounters are designed to test the characters in battle, while others encourage roleplaying. All of them paint a picture of Icewind Dale as a harsh realm full of a wide variety of creatures struggling to survive. An encounter's difficulty—noted as Easy, Medium, Hard, or Deadly in the Difficulty column of the Random Wilderness Encounters table—assumes the characters are 4th, 5th, or 6th level. It's okay for some encounters to be easy and others to be hard or deadly. Easy encounters build players' confidence; hard and deadly encounters force players to weigh their characters' options and think outside the box.

Roll a [[/r d8]] and consult the <a href=\"https://5etools-mirror-1.github.io/adventure.html#IDRotF,12,awakened%20beast%20encounter,0\">Awakened Beast Encounter table</a> to determine what kind of awakened beast the characters encounter.</p>\n<div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"1377\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Running the Encounter.</span></span>\n<p>An awakened beast looks the same as its normal counterpart, except for a hint or gleam of intelligence in its eyes. It can be neutral or evil, at your discretion. An awakened beast's task is to spy on the characters and ascertain where they might be headed, then report back to its master—the frost druid who awakened it. This druid might be nearby or many miles away (your choice).

If the beast is a dangerous predator such as a bear, tiger, or wolf, it keeps its distance from the adventuring party so as not to provoke the characters into attacking it. If it is harmed, the awakened beast retreats to a safe distance. If it's cornered and doesn't like its chances of survival, it bargains or pleads for its life. An awakened beast knows its territory well and can point characters to nearby locations of interest, food sources, or safe places to rest in exchange for its safety.</p>\n<p>An awakened beast can be persuaded to help the characters, and perhaps even join the party for a time. Convincing a neutral awakened beast to travel with the party requires an offering of food or shelter accompanied by a successful DC 10 Charisma (<span class=\"help help--hover\" data-plut-hover=\"true\" data-plut-hover-preload=\"true\" data-plut-hover-preload-id=\"221\">Persuasion</span>) group check. If the group check succeeds, the beast remains with the party for 24 hours, after which the characters can repeat the group check to extend the duration another 24 hours. An evil awakened beast accepts any offer to join the party (no check required), hoping to gather more information about the characters or lead them into a trap.</p>\n<p>If asked to give its name, the awakened beast either comes up with a name on the fly or adopts a suggested name that it likes. If you're having trouble coming up with a voice for the awakened beast, try mimicking the speech of a cartoon character or a famous actor.</p>\n<table class=\"rd__table  stripe-odd-table\"><caption>Awakened Beast Encounter</caption>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th class=\"col-2 text-center\" data-rd-isroller=\"true\">[[/r d8]]</th>\n<th class=\"col-10\" data-rd-isroller=\"false\">Awakened Beast</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"col-2 text-center\" data-roll-min=\"1\" data-roll-max=\"1\">1</td>\n<td class=\"col-10\">@Actor[8Z9Px1tgMNIb6B17]{Polar bear}</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"col-2 text-center\" data-roll-min=\"2\" data-roll-max=\"2\">2</td>\n<td class=\"col-10\">Arctic @Actor[AXA6Gfx0iGcpOuKg]{fox} (see <a href=\"https://5etools-mirror-1.github.io/adventure.html#IDRotF,21\">appendix C</a>)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"col-2 text-center\" data-roll-min=\"3\" data-roll-max=\"3\">3</td>\n<td class=\"col-10\">Snowshoe @Actor[MrUdIPHilLBApPkp]{hare} (see <a href=\"https://5etools-mirror-1.github.io/adventure.html#IDRotF,21\">appendix C</a>)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"col-2 text-center\" data-roll-min=\"4\" data-roll-max=\"4\">4</td>\n<td class=\"col-10\">Snowy @Actor[Z6WqNzFW24UddzCr]{owl}</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"col-2 text-center\" data-roll-min=\"5\" data-roll-max=\"5\">5</td>\n<td class=\"col-10\">@Actor[CtMI2k0WmgDByvLE]{Reindeer} (use the @Actor[sNKpqEOkJ9Rz02gt]{elk} stat block) with glow-in-the-dark antlers that emit dim light in a 10-foot radius</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"col-2 text-center\" data-roll-min=\"6\" data-roll-max=\"6\">6</td>\n<td class=\"col-10\">Woolly @Actor[4SYha5U3evYxSgBk]{rhinoceros}</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"col-2 text-center\" data-roll-min=\"7\" data-roll-max=\"7\">7</td>\n<td class=\"col-10\">@Actor[ybL0xYvtljuD3G9X]{Saber-toothed tiger}</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"col-2 text-center\" data-roll-min=\"8\" data-roll-max=\"8\">8</td>\n<td class=\"col-10\">@Actor[rMaDkbtGTnErYLMH]{Wolf}</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"1378\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Battlehammer Dwarves</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></span>\n<p>The shield dwarves of Clan Battlehammer have iron mines throughout the valley that extends from the base of Kelvin's Cairn.

Lower-level characters can survive the encounters in these locations if they're cautious and manage their resources well, although they should be prepared to flee or hide when they find themselves out of their depth. Characters of 6th level or higher will face few real challenges, but you can soften them up and deplete their resources by staging random encounters as they travel to and from a given location.</p>\n<div class=\"rd__wrp-gallery\">\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"float-clear\"> </div>\n<div class=\"rd__wrp-gallery-image\">\n<div class=\"rd__wrp-image relative\"><a title=\"Map 2.1: icewind dale\" href=\"https://5etools-mirror-1.github.io/img/adventure/IDRotF/095-map-2.1-icewind-dale.png\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> <img class=\"rd__image\" src=\"https://5etools-mirror-1.github.io/img/adventure/IDRotF/095-map-2.1-icewind-dale.png\" /> </a></div>\n<div class=\"rd__image-title\">\n<div class=\"rd__image-title-inner \">Map 2.1: icewind dale</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"float-clear\"> </div>\n<div class=\"rd__wrp-gallery-image\">\n<div class=\"rd__wrp-image relative\"><a title=\"Player Version\" href=\"https://5etools-mirror-1.github.io/img/adventure/IDRotF/096-map-2.1-icewind-dale-player.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> <img class=\"rd__image\" src=\"https://5etools-mirror-1.github.io/img/adventure/IDRotF/096-map-2.1-icewind-dale-player.jpg\" /> </a></div>\n<div class=\"rd__image-title\">\n<div class=\"rd__image-title-inner \">Player Version</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p> </p>\n</div>\n<hr class=\"rd__hr rd__hr--section\" />\n<div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--0\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--0\" data-title-index=\"1418\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Angajuk's Bell</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></span>\n<p>Swimming in the frigid waters is the legendary Angajuk, an old awakened sperm whale with a boat on its back. Most sperm whales live to be seventy years old, but Angajuk has been plying the waters of the Sea of Moving Ice for two hundred years. Throughout its life, the whale has faced its share of trouble, including near-fatal encounters with Auril's roc, which left scars along the whale's pectoral fins and body.</p>\n<p>Angajuk is famous among Ten-Towners. Most people leave it alone, knowing that the whale is the beneficiary of powerful magic, but uncaring hunters see the whale as a source of ambergris, which is a valuable commodity.</p>\n<p>Angajuk was once the companion of a druid named Anga, who cast an @Item[bcu9EHHbJ6JfYzHo]{awaken} spell on Angajuk to give the whale sentience and intelligence. Not much is known about Anga, but those who befriend Angajuk can learn about its beloved companion.</p>\n<p>Characters might learn about Angajuk by overhearing a rumor in Ten-Towns (see \"Tall Tales in Ten-Towns\") or by agreeing to help a whale oil merchant (see \"Whale Oil Acquisition\"). Angajuk is one of the safest ways to get to Auril's island, because the sperm whale can travel beneath the water's surface, avoiding Auril's spies. When the whale is submerged, a magic bubble surrounds the boat to protect those riding in it.</p>\n<p>Angajuk periodically visits an anchorage off the coastline, a rocky arch formed by the action of tidal waters, and can be summoned there by ringing a bell attached to the pier. Thick ice covers this rock formation, extending all the way to the shore. On the shore nearby is Anga's old stone cabin, which has weathered time's passage.</p>\n<div class=\"rd__wrp-gallery\">\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"float-clear\"> </div>\n<div class=\"rd__wrp-gallery-image\">\n<div class=\"rd__wrp-image relative\"><a title=\"Map 2.2: angajuk's bell\" href=\"https://5etools-mirror-1.github.io/img/adventure/IDRotF/097-map-2.2-angajuks-bell.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> <img class=\"rd__image\" src=\"https://5etools-mirror-1.github.io/img/adventure/IDRotF/097-map-2.2-angajuks-bell.jpg\" /> </a></div>\n<div class=\"rd__image-title\">\n<div class=\"rd__image-title-inner \">Map 2.2: angajuk's bell</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"float-clear\"> </div>\n<div class=\"rd__wrp-gallery-image\">\n<div class=\"rd__wrp-image relative\"><a title=\"Player Version\" href=\"https://5etools-mirror-1.github.io/img/adventure/IDRotF/098-map-2.2-angajuks-bell-player.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> <img class=\"rd__image\" src=\"https://5etools-mirror-1.github.io/img/adventure/IDRotF/098-map-2.2-angajuks-bell-player.jpg\" /> </a></div>\n<div class=\"rd__image-title\">\n<div class=\"rd__image-title-inner \">Player Version</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p> </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"1419\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Angajuk's Bell Locations</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></span>\n<p>The following locations are keyed to map 2.2.</p>\n<div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"1420\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">A1.

The place has been vacant for decades.</p>\n<p>Thick rime coats every surface and object inside the cabin, including a bed draped in a thick knit blanket. Beside the bed, a small hearth holds a precious store of firewood. The firewood is infested with worms that have eaten away at the tender parts of the wood, but it's safe to burn. There is enough wood to fuel a nightly fire for three days, and it is stored in six bundles that weigh 30 pounds each.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"1422\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">A3.

Angajuk has an Intelligence of 10 and speaks Common. Its deep, resonant voice carries a slight echo. Once the whale appears, characters must persuade it to be of service (see \"Earning Angajuk's Trust\" below). Otherwise, it submerges and departs after a few minutes. If the whale is befriended and the characters communicate their desired destination to it, Angajuk takes them where they want to go provided the location is on or in the Sea of Moving Ice.

Although it smells foul when initially exposed to air, the scent grows sweet over time. As such, ambergris is popular among perfumers as well as mages who use the greasy substance in various arcane rituals. The raw form of ambergris is a waxy lump approximately 2 feet long.</p>\n<div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"1429\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">The Whale Hunters</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></span>\n<p>Five whale hunters (neutral evil human @Actor[3xP5QvMNgEQAeRQf]{thugs}) were staying at the Black-Bearded Brother, a tavern in Bremen, when they learned about Angajuk's Bell. The hunters arrive shortly after the characters but before the whale's arrival. They wear cold weather clothing and have brought four casks of oil with them. They intend to pour the oil through the hole in the ice, contaminating the water around Angajuk's Bell and poisoning the creatures in it.</p>\n<p>The leader of the hunters, an older gray-haired man named Jendren Uruth, tries to recruit the characters, offering each of them an equal share of \"the take.\" Jendren is not an honest man, but his fight is against Angajuk, not a well-armed party of adventurers. If the characters stand between him and his prey, however, Jendren tries to intimidate them into leaving Angajuk's Bell. Scaring him off requires a successful DC 17 Charisma (<span class=\"help help--hover\" data-plut-hover=\"true\" data-plut-hover-preload=\"true\" data-plut-hover-preload-id=\"238\">Intimidation</span>) group check, since he's dead set on getting his ambergris. If the party's group check succeeds, Jendren and his fellow hunters withdraw, only to return 24 hours later.</p>\n<p>If the characters fail to keep the hunters from executing their plan, the oil poisons and muddies the water for 4 days. After a day of contamination, several dead knucklehead trout float to the surface. However, much to the hunters' dismay, the sperm whale avoids the area even after the bell is rung. (For as long as the water is poisoned, Angajuk realizes this and cannot be summoned.) While waiting for the whale, the hunters camp out on the pier or in Anga's cabin. After three more days, they conclude that the poison didn't work and that the whale needs to be lured to the surface with bait. The desperate hunters try to capture a character to use for this purpose and, if successful, bind and lower the character into the water as a lure. Angajuk rises just long enough to fling the lure out of the water, sending the character sprawling across the ice, before submerging and leaving the area, denying the hunters their prize.</p>\n<p>Jendren's death breaks the morale of the other hunters, who head back to Bremen in defeat.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"float-clear\"> </div>\n<div>\n<div class=\"rd__wrp-image relative\"><a title=\"Angajuk takes adventurers on an undersea tour\" href=\"https://5etools-mirror-1.github.io/img/adventure/IDRotF/099-02-006.angajuk.png\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> <img class=\"rd__image\" src=\"https://5etools-mirror-1.github.io/img/adventure/IDRotF/099-02-006.angajuk.png\" /> </a></div>\n<div class=\"rd__image-title\">\n<div class=\"rd__image-title-inner \">Angajuk takes adventurers on an undersea tour</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p> </p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<hr class=\"rd__hr rd__hr--section\" />\n<div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--0\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--0\" data-title-index=\"1430\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Black Cabin</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></span>\n<p>Characters might be drawn to this location by a tale told in Ten-Towns (see the Tall Tales in Ten-Towns table) or by a desire to help a gnome in Bryn Shander (see \"Provisions for Macreadus\"), or they might happen upon the Black Cabin while crossing the open tundra.</p>\n<div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"1431\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Secret of the Black Cabin</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></span>\n<p>The Black Cabin was built by a ranger of the Far North long before the founding of Ten-Towns. When he moved on, the lodge became a refuge for others seeking sanctuary from the wind sweeping down from the Reghed Glacier.</p>\n<p>Six months ago, Macreadus, a sage and devout follower of Lathander (god of the dawn and rebirth), formed a plan to end Auril's everlasting winter. He holed up in the Black Cabin, where he spent all his time assembling a weather-controlling magical device called the <em>Summer Star</em>, using knowledge he gleaned from a book about Netherese artifacts. Macreadus's device was similar in design to a <em>mythallar</em> (see <a href=\"https://5etools-mirror-1.github.io/adventure.html#IDRotF,22,%7b%40item%20ythryn%20mythallar%7cidrotf%7d,0\">appendix D</a>), but much smaller. Unfortunately for him, it had a serious design flaw. When Macreadus tried to use it three days ago, it malfunctioned, incinerating both him and his book. Characters who search the cabin can find the sage's charred skeleton and his deadly creation.</p>\n<p>Since the mishap, Macreadus's restless spirit has lingered in the Border Ethereal, unwilling to depart until its work is complete. (For more information on the Border Ethereal, see the \"<a href=\"https://5etools-mirror-1.github.io/book.html#DMG,2,ethereal%20plane,0\">Ethereal Plane</a>\" section in the <a href=\"https://5etools-mirror-1.github.io/book.html#DMG\">Dungeon Master's Guide</a>.)</p>\n<div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"1432\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Spirit of Macreadus</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></span>\n<p>From the Border Ethereal, the restless spirit of Macreadus can observe happenings in and around the cabin, but it can't manifest physically on the Material Plane. Characters can see the restless spirit of Macreadus and interact with it only if they cross over to the Border Ethereal, which is what happens to someone who dies in the cabin (see \"Dying in the Black Cabin\" below).</p>\n<p>In the Border Ethereal, the spirit of Macreadus manifests as a giant, floating, spectral head with fire burning in its eyes. Arrogant in life, Macreadus remains so in death. He's snappy and egotistical, blaming everything but himself for his failure. He welcomes the company of others, but anyone who questions his motives or mocks his invention quickly loses his favor. He spent months locked away in the cabin, building the <em>Summer Star</em> so he could end the Everlasting Rime, becoming more and more desperate to see it through. He had hoped to make a name for himself and win Lathander's praise—is that so wrong?</p>\n<p>If the characters try to finish his work, Macreadus helps as much as his bodiless form allows. To lay his spirit to rest, the characters must fix his creation's design flaw and then activate it, all within the confines of the Black Cabin, where Macreadus can observe the results. Once he sees the device working as intended, his spirit departs to the afterlife.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"1433\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Dying in the Black Cabin</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></span>\n<p>If a creature with an Intelligence of 3 or higher dies inside the Black Cabin, its spirit (if it has one) leaves its body and assumes a spectral form on the Border Ethereal until the creature is brought back from the dead. This is what happened to Macreadus, and the same fate awaits characters who perish in the cabin.</p>\n<p>If a character dies in the cabin and its spirit manifests in the Border Ethereal, the player can choose the form the spirit takes. It might look like a spectral image of the dead character, or it might be something bizarre like a ghostly crow or a blob of ectoplasmic energy.</p>\n<p>Regardless of the form it takes, the spirit is not a creature and can't be harmed or turned. It can't make attack rolls and doesn't make saving throws, and conditions don't apply to it. It can't cast spells or attune to magic items. Creatures on the Material Plane can't see the spirit without some ability or magic that lets them gaze into the Border Ethereal. A spirit in the Border Ethereal can't speak to creatures on the Material Plane, or vice versa.</p>\n<p>The spirit can do the following and nothing else:</p>\n<ul class=\"rd__list\">\n<li class=\"rd__li \">The spirit can move through the Border Ethereal. It has a flying speed of 30 feet, and it can hover. It can pass through solid surfaces that are visible on the Material Plane to explore closed-off parts of the cabin; it is bound to the cabin, however, and can't move more than 30 feet away from it.</li>\n<li class=\"rd__li \">The spirit can make ability checks based on Dexterity, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma only. It applies no modifiers to these checks.</li>\n<li class=\"rd__li \">As an action, the spirit can attempt to exert up to 5 pounds of force on a creature or object no more than 5 feet away from it in the Material Plane, doing so with a successful DC 10 Charisma check. The spirit might use this ability to move a tiny object, write a message on a frosty or sooty surface, operate a simple tool, or tap someone on the shoulder, but the force isn't strong enough to cause harm to a creature.</li>\n<li class=\"rd__li \">The spirit can see other spirits in the Border Ethereal (including the spirit of Macreadus) and speak to them.

You also catch the faint odor of wine. Snow has fallen through holes in the roof, then been pushed into corners by stiff winds blowing through broken windows. The walls and furniture are scorched black, including a table with the charred remains of a book on it. Next to the table, on the floor amid several broken wine bottles, is a mostly incinerated skeleton and a round, frost-covered object about six inches in diameter.</p>\n<div class=\"float-clear\"> </div>\n</div>\n<p>The important features of this room are the charred book, the partially incinerated skeleton on the floor, and the round object lying nearby (the <em>Summer Star</em>, described below).

The Summer Star has lost its luster but not its magic. A @Item[7UQbR0QBDy5qog2G]{detect magic} spell or similar magic reveals a weak, residual aura of transmutation magic surrounding it.</p>\n<div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"> </div>\n<p>The first time a creature picks up the <em>Summer Star</em>, its core glows with a golden radiance as bright as a candle flame. Unless the creature drops the device immediately, the light suddenly blossoms, becoming a 10-foot-radius sphere of incinerating golden radiance centered on the device. Each creature in the sphere must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw, taking 90 ([[/r 10d10 + 35]]) radiant damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. If this effect reduces a creature to 0 hit points and there is damage remaining, the creature is turned to ashes if the remaining damage equals or exceeds its hit point maximum. Once the explosion is triggered, the <em>Summer Star</em> becomes inoperable and safe to handle.</p>\n<p>A character killed by the <em>Summer Star</em> becomes an ethereal spirit bound to the Black Cabin (see \"Dying in the Black Cabin\"). Don't fret if this happens to one or more characters; as spirits, they can figure out a way back to the realm of the living.</p>\n<p>Once the <em>Summer Star</em> discharges its residual magic, the characters—both the material and the ethereal ones—can safely analyze and fix the device so that it functions as Macreadus intended. The steps to be followed are summarized below:</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"1443\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Step 1: Identify the Item.</span></span>\n<p>Any creature or spirit that studies the runes on the device's rings and succeeds on a DC 18 Intelligence (<span class=\"help help--hover\" data-plut-hover=\"true\" data-plut-hover-preload=\"true\" data-plut-hover-preload-id=\"239\">Arcana</span>) check ascertains that the device was designed to control the weather. An @Item[pXMP6M2bo0ECkh6p]{identify} spell reveals the same, and Macreadus's spirit can freely divulge this information to other spirits. A character who has Macreadus's blueprints from the laboratory (area B6) can use them to gain advantage on the check.</p>\n<div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"> </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"1444\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Step 2: Analyze the Problem.</span></span>\n<p>The device has a design flaw, obviously. Macreadus has concluded that the device's rings are unable to contain the magical energy that the core puts out. A third ring must be attached to the device, and this new ring must have runes like those that appear on the other two rings. A character who succeeds on a DC 15 Intelligence (<span class=\"help help--hover\" data-plut-hover=\"true\" data-plut-hover-preload=\"true\" data-plut-hover-preload-id=\"240\">Insight</span>) check comes to this conclusion. The check is made with advantage if the character witnessed the device malfunction.</p>\n<div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"> </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"1445\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Step 3: Fix the Design Flaw.</span></span>\n<p>To craft a third ring, a quarter-pound of metal must be melted down in a fire and recast using smith's tools, then inscribed with runes by someone with a steady hand—that is, a character who succeeds on a DC 15 Dexterity (<span class=\"help help--hover\" data-plut-hover=\"true\" data-plut-hover-preload=\"true\" data-plut-hover-preload-id=\"241\">Arcana</span>) check. Using tinker's tools provides advantage on the check. Finally, the device must be modified to accommodate the third ring, using either smith's tools or tinker's tools. The modification process can be completed in a few hours.</p>\n<div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"> </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"1446\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Step 4: Activate the Item.</span></span>\n<p>A character must attune to the modified Summer Star to use it. While holding the device, the attuned character can use an action to cast the @Item[PGIv3SBbccVo7xfV]{control weather} spell from it, without the need for the character or the Summer Star to be outdoors. After the spell is cast, the Summer Star ceases to be magical. The spell lasts for the duration or until the character's concentration ends.</p>\n<div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"> </div>\n<p>Macreadus knows what must be done to fix the device but can't activate the item because he's dead. If no one can attune to the modified <em>Summer Star</em> because everyone in the party is dead and trapped as a spirit in the Border Ethereal, nothing more can be done with the device until someone else comes along who can attune to it. Fortunately for the characters, they don't have long to wait before someone arrives (see the \"Werebear Visitor\" sidebar). Characters in spirit form can convince the new arrival to do what they cannot, perhaps by writing messages in the snow, or on a section of wall or floor using ash from a nearby fireplace.</p>\n<p>Macreadus's spirit can finally rest after it witnesses the activation of the new and improved <em>Summer Star</em>. As it departs, the party receives a special blessing from Lathander. Any party member who died within the past 24 hours is instantly restored to life at full health, regardless of how the character died. In addition, each character who helped lay Macreadus's spirit to rest gains a <em>blessing of the Morninglord</em> (described below). For rules on blessings, see \"<a href=\"https://5etools-mirror-1.github.io/book.html#DMG,7,supernatural%20gifts,0\">Supernatural Gifts</a>\" in the <a href=\"https://5etools-mirror-1.github.io/book.html#DMG\">Dungeon Master's Guide</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"rd__b-special rd__b-inset \"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2-inset rd__h--2-inset-no-name\"><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-special-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></span>\n<div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"1447\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Blessing of the Morninglord.</span></span>\n<p>You gain 10 temporary hit points each day at dawn.</p>\n<div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"> </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"float-clear\"> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"1448\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Weak Floor.</span></span>\n<p>The section of floor shown on map 2.3 has weakened over time and gives way if 150 pounds or more of weight crosses it. Any creature standing on the floor when it collapses must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature falls to the bottom of the gorge directly below this section of the cabin, taking 49 ([[/r 14d6]]) bludgeoning damage and landing @condition[prone]. On a successful save, the creature grabs hold of the edge of the remaining floor and is hanging from it. The creature can use an action to try to pull itself up, doing so with a successful DC 10 Strength (<span class=\"help help--hover\" data-plut-hover=\"true\" data-plut-hover-preload=\"true\" data-plut-hover-preload-id=\"242\">Athletics</span>) check, while another creature within reach can use the @action[Help] action to assist. A hanging creature can repeat the check until it succeeds, but if a check fails by 5 or more, the creature lets go and falls.</p>\n<div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"1449\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">B5.

The gnolls of the Cackling Chasm, like all gnolls, were born in this fashion. But a rift has formed between the creator and its creations. The fang of Yeenoghu, Chyzka, is being blamed for the pack's recent misfortunes. It led the gnolls to Icewind Dale, promising abundant food. What the gnolls got instead was an unending winter and barely enough nourishment to sustain them. The gnolls are forced to resort to cannibalism to survive when food is scarce, and the pack has no hyenas to replenish its dwindling numbers.

If she doesn't notice the characters, she makes her way to her hoard, inspects the hold to make sure nothing is out of place, and leaves the ship to find and eat a tasty walrus. If she sees that the hoard has been disturbed, the dragon looks around the ship to see if the thieves left tracks and follows any she finds, calling out to Meltharond to ready his spells. If she suspects that intruders are still aboard the vessel but hiding in places she can't reach, she breaks through walls to get at them.</p>\n<p>The characters are no match for the dragon. If they need a distraction to facilitate their escape, Meltharond's corpse could fall out of its saddle.

Furthermore, the characters' triumph earns them a reward: access to the vault under the hill.

That's a hard lesson for a rock gnome sorcerer to learn.</p>\n<p>Five years ago, before Icewind Dale became the perpetually frozen hellscape it is today, @Actor[NS8b3PzSNCjrv8Dc]{Spellix Romwod} was traveling through the mountain pass with a small caravan when it was caught in an avalanche. The goblins who triggered the avalanche captured Spellix's mates and dragged them back to their caves in the mountains to be eaten. Spellix, whom the goblins overlooked, followed them and devised a cunning plan to free his companions. Using materials scavenged from the wrecked caravan, he engineered a costume for himself. Disguised as a half-metal goblin, he infiltrated the goblins' lair and did his best to fit in, cleverly using @Item[YEAvSniXyJgcQGtS]{silent image} spells to hide the imperfections in his disguise. When he was offered a bone to gnaw on, his mechanical goblin mouth malfunctioned and wouldn't stop grinding its teeth. Thus, @Actor[NS8b3PzSNCjrv8Dc]{Spellix Romwod} came to be known as Yarb-Gnock, which means \"Ever-Gnawing\" in Goblin.</p>\n<p>Spellix was repulsed by the goblins' squalor and took pity on them. Abandoning all concern for his former mates, whom he didn't particularly like anyway, Spellix adopted the name given to him by the goblins and spent the next several months engineering ways to improve their standard of living. Long after the other members of the caravan had been eaten, Yarb-Gnock became the new chief after the previous one choked to death on a mountain goat tongue. By then, Yarb-Gnock had already drawn up plans to build a fortress in the mountains. Karkolohk, the Gnomish word for \"home,\" became the goblin tribe's dream of a better future.</p>\n<p>As the goblins were finishing construction of their new home, everlasting winter descended upon Icewind Dale. Fewer caravans made their way through the mountain pass, forcing Chief Yarb-Gnock to send goblin wagons far and wide in search of food and resources. Despite his best efforts, the gnome-in-goblin's-clothing could sense that the tribe was becoming increasingly frustrated. The goblins felt like they were working harder for less, and a few are beginning to suspect that Chief Yarb-Gnock is a fraud.</p>\n<p>Cooped up in the cold with creatures that would kill him if they learned the truth, Chief Yarb-Gnock is running out of ideas to keep the goblins motivated on other tasks and has begun to fear that the goblins are on to him. His costume is beginning to come apart, and paranoia has made him sleep-deprived. The number of \"traitors\" hurled from the mountaintop increases with every cycle of the moon, and the goblins don't know who among them are Yarb-Gnock's loyal spies. Mistrust has infected every nook and cranny of Karkolohk.</p>\n<p>@Actor[NS8b3PzSNCjrv8Dc]{Spellix Romwod} was beginning to think that the time had come to abandon his goblin kin and seek refuge in Ten-Towns when, two days ago, his fortunes improved suddenly. Goblins out scavenging in a wagon stumbled across a curious object in the tundra—a metallic, egg-shaped crate. (This object was jettisoned from an illithid nautiloid soon before it crashed in the mountains to the east, as described in \"Id Ascendant\"), Chief Yarb-Gnock thinks the crate might hold something wondrous, and getting it open has become his new obsession.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"1566\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Karkolohk Overview</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></span>\n<p>The goblins of Karkolohk often haunt the trail that connects Ten-Towns to other settlements farther south, though it sees little traffic nowadays. Prisoners are kept in dangling cages until they freeze to death, whereupon the goblins cook and eat them.</p>\n<p>Deep tracks left by goblin wagons lead to and from Karkolohk, making it easy to find despite the heavy snowfall. Once the characters are within the foothills and travel high enough to breach the clouds, the fortress becomes visible about from a mile away.</p>\n<p>The fortress is worked into the spur of a mountain slope in a way that uses the natural environment to its advantage. Situated at the top of a hill, goblin lookouts have an excellent view of anyone approaching.</p>\n<p>The weather in the mountains is so violent that Karkolohk's structures occasionally come loose and crash down the mountainside. Other times, chemistry experiments gone awry send wooden structures up in flames. Thus, the fort is always bustling with construction and repairs.</p>\n<div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"1567\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Goblin Mindset</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></span>\n<p>Chief Yarb-Gnock has taught the goblins to seize their destiny and stop at nothing to get what they want. Opportunistic creatures that they are, they take any sign of weakness as an opening to gain an advantage. If bullying and intimidation don't work, the goblins use more underhanded and passive-aggressive tactics. If they think that they are at a disadvantage or that they will come to an unavoidable loss, the goblins will do whatever they can to backtrack out of such a situation, be it through bribery, wheedling, or treachery.</p>\n<p>Visitors are not welcome at Karkolohk. Moreover, the goblins who live here detest non-goblins, especially gnomes. Were the goblins just a little smarter, they would see through Chief Yarb-Gnock's crude disguise and the magic he uses to hides its imperfections, and tear @Actor[NS8b3PzSNCjrv8Dc]{Spellix Romwod} limb from limb.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"1568\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Gnome Diplomacy</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></span>\n<p>If you decide to use the \"Peace Out\" quest (see \"Peace Out\"), the characters are treated as diplomats by the goblins and permitted to approach and enter the fortress unmolested, provided they do no harm to its inhabitants. Assuming they avoid a violent altercation, the characters are escorted by a @Actor[3bhYPNLwbT0Cn0gr]{goblin} to Yarb-Gnock's dining hall (area K11) for a private feast with the chief. This feast consists of a cooked mountain goat. What happens next depends on Yarb-Gnock's goal, which can be one of the following:</p>\n<ul class=\"rd__list\">\n<li class=\"rd__li \">If Yarb-Gnock's goal is to make peace with Ten-Towns, he gives the party a rolled-up strip of rabbit hide at the end of the meal. On this strip of hide he has written a brief, formal notice in Common addressed to the Council of Speakers of Ten-Towns. It asserts that the goblins of Karkolohk will refrain from attacking travelers and caravans heading to and from Ten-Towns for as long as the peace treaty between Ten-Towns and Karkolohk lasts, and it bears Yarb-Gnock's signature at the bottom. After handing them the message, Yarb-Gnock urges the characters to leave at once and deliver it to the Council Hall in Bryn Shander.</li>\n<li class=\"rd__li \">If Yarb-Gnock's goal is to flee Karkolohk, the meal concludes with Yarb-Gnock requesting that the characters escort him to the Council Hall in Bryn Shander. Mistaking any attempt by Yarb-Gnock to leave Karkolohk as an abduction orchestrated by the characters, the goblins attack the characters as they try to flee the fortress with Yarb-Gnock in tow. During this escape attempt, Yarb-Gnock fights only in self-defense, counting on the characters to deal with any goblins that get in the way.</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"rd__wrp-gallery\">\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"float-clear\"> </div>\n<div class=\"rd__wrp-gallery-image\">\n<div class=\"rd__wrp-image relative\"><a title=\"Map 2.9: karkolohk\" href=\"https://5etools-mirror-1.github.io/img/adventure/IDRotF/128-map-2.9-karkolohk.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> <img class=\"rd__image\" src=\"https://5etools-mirror-1.github.io/img/adventure/IDRotF/128-map-2.9-karkolohk.jpg\" /> </a></div>\n<div class=\"rd__image-title\">\n<div class=\"rd__image-title-inner \">Map 2.9: karkolohk</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"float-clear\"> </div>\n<div class=\"rd__wrp-gallery-image\">\n<div class=\"rd__wrp-image relative\"><a title=\"Player Version\" href=\"https://5etools-mirror-1.github.io/img/adventure/IDRotF/129-map-2.9-karkolohk-player.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> <img class=\"rd__image\" src=\"https://5etools-mirror-1.github.io/img/adventure/IDRotF/129-map-2.9-karkolohk-player.jpg\" /> </a></div>\n<div class=\"rd__image-title\">\n<div class=\"rd__image-title-inner \">Player Version</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p> </p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"1569\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Karkolohk Locations (K1-K7)</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></span>\n<p>The following locations are keyed to map 2.9.</p>\n<div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"1570\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">K1.

They also need to operate the goblins' system of pulleys and ropes to lower it to the ground; figuring out how the system works requires a successful DC 15 Intelligence check.</p>\n<div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"> </div>\n<p>The shield guardian was built by a Netherese wizard and is nearly two thousand years old. Carved into its massive forearms is the wizard's personal sigil. After the wizard's tower crashed, the guardian left the spire to go find help but got buried in an avalanche. It eventually shut down. Centuries later, a band of goblins dug it out and hauled it back to Karkolohk. Unfortunately for them, the guardian could not be reactivated. After some thought, Chief Yarb-Gnock decided to dangle it from this platform, using ropes and pulleys like puppet strings to make the guardian appear animate and terrifying. This construct must have been a lively sight to behold at one point, but the aura of menace surrounding it quickly faded, and the goblins lost all interest in it.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"1577\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">K6.

The wizard's shield guardian not only survived but also dug its way out, creating a tunnel that others can use to reach the spire's interior. Until recently, the mouth of this tunnel was buried under ice and snow. After exiting the spire, the shield guardian wandered into the Spine of the World, where it shut down and was lost for centuries until a band of goblins found it recently and brought it to their mountain fort (see \"Karkolohk\").</p>\n<p>The characters can learn about the spire in Ten-Towns (see \"Tall Tales in Ten-Towns\"), or they might stumble upon it accidentally while hunting (see \"Hunt for the Red Yeti\").

Krintaas, who also lacks a life-spark, is impatiently waiting for @Actor[5MftpKOHhDSOiyll]{Dzaan} to return and quash the simulacrum's efforts to test the rune chamber. Neither the simulacrum nor Krintaas is aware that the real @Actor[5MftpKOHhDSOiyll]{Dzaan} is dead (see \"Toil and Trouble\").</p>\n<p>When the characters show up, @Actor[1BMPDdTIo0dt3m2x]{Dzaan's simulacrum} is ecstatic.

The warriors and hunters like to conserve their strength for when it's needed, preferring to spend their idle hours doing as little as possible. Telling familiar stories and inventing new ones that glorify the nomads' outlook on life are common pastimes (see the \"Reghed Stories\" sidebar), as is sharpening weapons.</p>\n<p>Food is critical, of course, and certain beasts of the tundra are staples among the Reghed tribes. Knucklehead trout and seals are often prepared for eating very near the scene of the kill, filleted or chopped and generally eaten raw. @Actor[CtMI2k0WmgDByvLE]{Reindeer} meat, on the other hand, must be cooked before consumption. @Actor[CtMI2k0WmgDByvLE]{Reindeer} also provide the Reghed tribes with sinew, bone, and hide, all of which are used in the manufacture of weapons and armor.</p>\n<div class=\"rd__b-special rd__b-inset \"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2-inset\" data-title-index=\"1636\"><span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Reghed Stories</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-special-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></span>\n<p>Reghed nomads pass the time by sharing stories that reinforce their values, which are as follows:</p>\n<ul class=\"rd__list\">\n<li class=\"rd__li \">The tribe is one spirit, always on the move.

Situated on the frigid, misty coast of the Sea of Moving Ice, the prison is a single-story structure topped with battlements. Rising from the core of the panopticon is a tower that holds the prison's administrative offices and guard barracks. Both the prison and the tower are carved out of a tall, blade-shaped rock that rises high above the sea cliffs. This rock, called the Windbreak, shields the tower against the brutal winds that sweep down from the Reghed Glacier.</p>\n<p>One can approach Revel's End by land, sea, or air. A pier allows prisoners to be taken from ships up an elevator to the prison, and a mooring dock at the top of the tower allows prisoners to be delivered by airship as well.</p>\n<p>Revel's End is controlled by the Lords' Alliance, a loose confederation of settlements whose current members include the cities of Baldur's Gate, Mirabar, Neverwinter, Silverymoon, Waterdeep, and Yartar; the towns of Amphail, Daggerford, and Longsaddle; and the dwarven stronghold of Mithral Hall. To be imprisoned in Revel's End, one must have committed a serious crime against one or more members of the alliance and been sentenced to a lengthy period of incarceration (typically a year or more). Moreover, the offender must have political connections that make incarceration in another facility less dependable. Captured spies, for example, are often brought here to cool their heels.</p>\n<p>Each member of the Lords' Alliance assigns one representative to Revel's End, and together they form a parole committee called the Absolution Council. Rarely are all ten council members present, since Revel's End offers little in the way of comfort and amenities. If the council needs a tie-breaking vote to determine whether to commute a prisoner's sentence, the prison warden—a neutral arbiter with no ties to any Lords' Alliance member—casts the deciding vote.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"float-clear\"> </div>\n<div>\n<div class=\"rd__wrp-image relative\"><a title=\"The remote prison of Revel's End contains many of the Sword Coast's most dangerous criminals\" href=\"https://5etools-mirror-1.github.io/img/adventure/IDRotF/137-02-023.revels-end.png\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> <img class=\"rd__image\" src=\"https://5etools-mirror-1.github.io/img/adventure/IDRotF/137-02-023.revels-end.png\" /> </a></div>\n<div class=\"rd__image-title\">\n<div class=\"rd__image-title-inner \">The remote prison of Revel's End contains many of the Sword Coast's most dangerous criminals</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"1638\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Involving the Characters</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></span>\n<p>The characters might be lured to Revel's End by one of the tales or quests at the start of this chapter that have to do with Vaelish Gant (see \"Tall Tales in Ten-Towns\" and \"Behind Bars\").

The spirit of Vlax takes control of Warden Marthannis once or twice a day, each time for an hour or two. While under its control, the warden can't cast her prepared spells, speaks only Dwarvish, and occasionally indulges Vlax's vice for ale and spirits. She also becomes moody and temperamental, though never resorts to violence without good cause.</p>\n<p>Warden Marthannis knows that to rid herself of Vlax's spirit, she must visit the Brawnanvil crypts in Gauntlgrym, a dwarven fortress under Mount Hotenow (near Neverwinter). Only there can the spirits of Vlax's kin persuade Vlax to join them in the afterlife. The warden refuses to make the journey, however, because she can't bear to lose all contact with Vlax. The warden has made her affliction known to the prison guards and Absolution Council members, and they have grown accustomed to her personality changes and bouts of drunkenness.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"1680\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Treasure.</span></span>\n<p>Among the chamber's furnishings is a locked wooden chest, for which the warden carries the only key.

He hoped that his work would help the Arcane Brotherhood gain control of the region. A few years ago, shortly after his arrival in Ten-Towns, Gant established a protection racket in Bryn Shander and tried to turn the town against its speaker, Duvessa Shane, with the goal of supplanting her. He also tried to destabilize the economy of Ten-Towns. A party of adventurers thwarted his criminal ventures by capturing him.</p>\n<p>Rather than put Gant to death for his crimes in Icewind Dale, the Council of Speakers in Ten-Towns made a deal with representatives of the Lords' Alliance to have Gant serve a life sentence in Revel's End, so as not to incur the Arcane Brotherhood's wrath. The Council of Speakers did this not realizing that Gant's scheme wasn't sanctioned by the Arcane Brotherhood but rather hatched by Gant himself, who intended to impress his superiors by pulling it off.</p>\n<p>For a long time, Gant held out hope that the Arcane Brotherhood would apply pressure to secure his release, and that the Lords' Alliance would acquiesce to the brotherhood's demands rather than risk an all-out attack on Revel's End. But by now, Gant has been incarcerated long enough to reasonably conclude that no such rescue is forthcoming. His failed scheme was an embarrassment to the Arcane Brotherhood, which has clearly forsaken him.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"float-clear\"> </div>\n<div>\n<div class=\"rd__wrp-image relative\"><a title=\"@Actor[YjDpd62n02wgdl5i]{Prisoner 237}\" href=\"https://5etools-mirror-1.github.io/img/adventure/IDRotF/140-637357081739596776.png\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> <img class=\"rd__image\" src=\"https://5etools-mirror-1.github.io/img/adventure/IDRotF/140-637357081739596776.png\" /> </a></div>\n<div class=\"rd__image-title\">\n<div class=\"rd__image-title-inner \">@Actor[YjDpd62n02wgdl5i]{Prisoner 237}</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"1684\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Roleplaying Vaelish Gant</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></span>\n<p>Vaelish Gant is a mage who specializes in the arcane tradition of abjuration. Pompous and conniving, he never doubts that he's the smartest person in the room, and he makes sure everyone around him knows how he feels.</p>\n<p>Gant has neither a spellbook nor material components for spellcasting, and he can't avail himself of his magic while locked in his cell due to the antimagic field that encompasses it.</p>\n<p>Gant spends his days and nights thinking about one thing: his freedom.

Gant doesn't expect the characters to oblige, but he has nothing left to lose but his life.</p>\n<p>Although he's unaware of any Arcane Brotherhood activities in Icewind Dale, Gant suspects that something is afoot if the characters start asking him about the organization. The last time he was at the Hosttower, shortly before his arrival in Ten-Towns a few years ago, Gant overheard his superiors talking about mounting an expedition to Icewind Dale, to search for a lost Netherese city buried under the Reghed Glacier. Gant had different plans for Icewind Dale at the time, but now the characters' visit gives him reason to believe an expedition might finally be under way. Gant shares this information with the characters if they show him the letter from Duvessa Shane (see \"Behind Bars\") or break him out of prison.</p>\n<p>Gant has no information that can help the characters find the lost Netherese city, but he's willing to share what he considers to be common knowledge about the Empire of Netheril:</p>\n<ul class=\"rd__list\">\n<li class=\"rd__li \">Netheril was a civilization ruled by powerful wizards. It fell more than a thousand years ago.</li>\n<li class=\"rd__li \">The Netherese learned their magic first from the elves, and later from the fabled <em>Nether Scrolls</em>. Netherese magic was far more powerful than present-day magic—so much so that it made even the gods tremble.</li>\n<li class=\"rd__li \">Evil, subterranean creatures known as phaerimm were instrumental in Netheril's fall, but it was hubris that ultimately spelled the empire's doom. Karsus, a Netherese archmage, tried to usurp the power of Mystryl, god of magic. He failed, destroying himself and tearing the Weave in the process. It would be years before anyone could use or control magic again.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If the characters ask Gant about other members of the Arcane Brotherhood they've met in Icewind Dale (see appendix C), Gant can share what he knows about any of them:</p>\n<ul class=\"rd__list\">\n<li class=\"rd__li \">About @Actor[ZdyzgxiVqFXzU3AP]{Avarice}, Gant says: \"The tiefling albino?

A yeti fur cloak is draped over her stooped shoulders, and a tiger-sized feline with white fur crouches beside her.</p>\n<div class=\"float-clear\"> </div>\n</div>\n<p>This cave is where Arn spends time with his family, namely his husband, Harad Cloudstrider Akannathi (a @Actor[xrLS2gEC75srOKGZ]{goliath warrior}), and Harad's elderly mother, Kaniaka Stormcrow Akannathi (a blind noncombatant). Each of them has private quarters off the main cave, where they keep their bedrolls.</p>\n<p>If the characters fought their way to this cave by killing other goliaths, Harad is awake and attacks them, since the fallen goliaths are his blood. Otherwise, Harad is asleep in his bedroll while Kaniaka sits by the fire, staring at it sightlessly, with a domesticated @Actor[LyPHSpJAV7xe2Bkj]{crag cat} (see <a href=\"https://5etools-mirror-1.github.io/adventure.html#IDRotF,21\">appendix C</a>) by her side. The cat protects Kaniaka but otherwise takes no aggressive actions.</p>\n<p>Kaniaka's hearing is sharp enough to distinguish the heavy footfalls of goliaths from those of smaller folk. She is suspicious of strangers just as other members of her clan are, but at her age, she feels compelled to listen to what they have to say. She would very much like to see an end to the conflict with the Wyrmdoom goliaths—if such a thing is possible.</p>\n<p>Magic can cure Kaniaka's blindness, and she becomes indebted to any character who restores her vision. Kaniaka is the only member of the Akannathi clan who has as much influence in Skytower Shelter as Arn does, and once her sight is restored, she can gently persuade him to listen to reason. With her help, the characters can convince Arn to meet with the chieftain of the Wyrmdoom goliaths, though he insists that any such meeting take place at Skytower Shelter.</p>\n<p>Any conversation with Kaniaka awakens her son, who stumbles out of his bedchamber with greataxe in hand to confront intruders. If the characters have gotten off on the wrong foot with Kaniaka, Harad threatens to punish them for their intrusion, though his sense of honor dictates that he cannot draw first blood. Thus, he tries to goad characters into wounding him first.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"1693\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">S5.

Unless the characters are accompanied by a member of the Akannathi clan, the goliaths try to frighten away the interlopers, attacking them if they refuse to leave. A clever character can win over the goliaths by challenging and beating one or more of them in a rock-holding contest. The contest plays out as follows:</p>\n<ul class=\"rd__list\">\n<li class=\"rd__li \">Each participant is given a pair of heavy rocks and must hold one in each hand while keeping their arms parallel to the floor.</li>\n<li class=\"rd__li \">At the end of each minute, each participant must succeed on a Strength (<span class=\"help help--hover\" data-plut-hover=\"true\" data-plut-hover-preload=\"true\" data-plut-hover-preload-id=\"289\">Athletics</span>) check to keep their arms raised. The DC starts at 5 and increases by 5 at the end of each minute thereafter. On a failed check, the participant drops their arms and is out of the game. If the last two participants fail at the same time, the contest ends in a tie.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Any character who wins a rock-holding contest earns the respect of the goliaths in this cave.

If one or more characters don't mediate the conversation, the meeting ends with each chieftain walking away in disgust at the other's unwillingness to accept blame. Allow the players time to devise a strategy for ending the impasse. Three possible solutions are presented below:</p>\n<ul class=\"rd__list\">\n<li class=\"rd__li \">The characters urge the chieftains, for the good of Icewind Dale, to unite against a common foe (such as Auril the Frostmaiden, Arveiaturace the White Wyrm, or @Actor[tL8JHA0z9pJcAquS]{Xardorok Sunblight}). Goliath warriors from both clans, working as allies, might learn to forget the past and forge a brighter future for all goliaths.</li>\n<li class=\"rd__li \">A character who has earned the respect of one or both clans convinces either chieftain that being the first to accept responsibility for a misunderstanding, even when others should share the blame, is a sign of moral strength and good character. Once one chieftain accepts blame, it's easier for the other to do the same.</li>\n<li class=\"rd__li \">The characters keep the chieftains talking—for days, if that's what it takes—by turning it into a contest of endurance. The two chieftains waste hours airing their grievances, then spend longer hours glaring at each other in stubborn silence. (The characters' patience is eventually rewarded when Ogolai has food and tea brought to her. She offers to share her repast with Arn, who begrudgingly accepts out of politeness. This moment marks a turning point as the chieftains agree that there can be no winner to this contest and, more important, that the contest is a metaphor for their pointless, long-standing feud.)</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<hr class=\"rd__hr rd__hr--section\" />\n<div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--0\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--0\" data-title-index=\"1706\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Wyrmdoom Crag</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></span>\n<p>Wyrmdoom Crag is one of two goliath settlements described in this chapter, the other being Skytower Shelter (see \"Skytower Shelter\"). Read both entries before running encounters in either location. Also review the \"Goliaths\" entry in <a href=\"https://5etools-mirror-1.github.io/adventure.html#IDRotF,21\">appendix C</a>, in particular the \"Spine of the World Goliaths\" section. There is also a list of goliath names you can draw from, as needed.</p>\n<p>Wyrmdoom Crag is home to the friendly Thuunlakalaga goliath clan. Shortly after establishing this lair for themselves, the goliaths were challenged by an adult white dragon. The dragon underestimated the goliaths' determination, and decades later, its skeletal remains still lie nearby as a testament to their triumph.</p>\n<p>There are three reasons why the characters might visit Wyrmdoom Crag:</p>\n<ul class=\"rd__list\">\n<li class=\"rd__li \">They're drawn to the location by a tall tale (see \"Tall Tales in Ten-Towns\") or by a quest to help Dannika Graysteel acquire some white dragon bones (see \"Dragon Bone Stew\").</li>\n<li class=\"rd__li \">One of the characters is a goliath from Wyrmdoom Crag who wants to return home.</li>\n<li class=\"rd__li \">The characters seek to end the feud between the goliaths of Skytower Shelter and Wyrmdoom Crag. (The characters will need to visit both locations to succeed in their mission.)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The Wyrmdoom goliaths are willing to share their dwelling with travelers and guests, but they hold a strong dislike for the goliaths of Skytower Shelter. The characters can learn the cause of that resentment by speaking to Ogolai, chieftain of the Thuunlakalaga clan.</p>\n<div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"1707\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Into the Mountains</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></span>\n<p>To get to either of the goliath outposts or to move between them, the characters need to negotiate the Spine of the World, where travel is the most difficult of any region in Icewind Dale.

The goliaths are rich in stories of their own and are not shy about sharing their history.</p>\n<p>Although these goliaths are friendly and welcoming, they bear a bitter grudge against the goliaths of Skytower Shelter and will treat any character hailing from that clan accordingly. Additionally, these goliaths have a strong distaste toward visitors who seek to stir up trouble beyond simple competitiveness.

There are also six goliath children (noncombatants), including the two speaking with the clan's chieftain, a @Actor[xrLS2gEC75srOKGZ]{goliath warrior} named Ogolai Orcsplitter Thuunlakalaga, who is endearingly called \"Old Goat\" by other clan members. Her greataxe has a haft made from white dragon bone, and her white cloak is magical (see \"<a href=\"https://5etools-mirror-1.github.io/adventure.html#IDRotF,12,treasure.%20ogolai's%20cloak%20has%20the%20magical%20properties%20of%20a%20%7b%40item%20cloak%20of%20protection%7d.,0\">Treasure</a>\" below). If a fight erupts here, nine more @Actor[xrLS2gEC75srOKGZ]{goliath warriors} arrive from area W7 to help put an end to it.</p>\n<p>Ogolai greets new arrivals and invites them to join her by the fire. If she takes a shine to them, she walks them back to the feasting cave (area W7) for a hot meal. If she is asked why the Skytower and Wyrmdoom goliaths don't get along, Ogolai says:</p>\n<div class=\"rd__b-special rd__b-inset rd__b-inset--readaloud \"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2-inset rd__h--2-inset-no-name\"><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-special-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></span>\n<p>\"Many summers ago, the children of Wyrmdoom challenged the children of Skytower to a game of goat-ball. During the game, the ball tumbled near one of the griffons of Skytower. When one of our children tried to fetch the ball, the griffon went berserk and grievously wounded her. The game was called off. Hungry for more of the child's flesh, the griffon haunted Wyrmdoom for days. Our hunters were forced to kill it to protect the child. The two clans have been opposed ever since.\"</p>\n<div class=\"float-clear\"> </div>\n</div>\n<p>Although she doesn't say so, Ogolai is the child who was wounded by the griffon, as the scars on her face suggest. To this day, she fears griffons and blames the Skytower goliaths for not keeping theirs under control.</p>\n<p>If the characters claim to be neutral arbiters seeking to end the conflict between the clans, Ogolai says she's prepared to meet with Arn Akannathi, the leader of the Skytower goliaths, but refuses to meet him at Skytower Shelter. Ogolai insists that the meeting occur on the goat-ball court at Wyrmdoom Crag, which she knows Arn will never agree to. Ogolai's refusal to conduct negotiations at Skytower Shelter stems from her deep-seeded fear of griffons, though she would never admit to this fact lest she appear weak. Ogolai is not interested in offering any goodwill gesture to Arn, whom she bluntly calls a \"walking stillborn.\"</p>\n<div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"1718\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Missing Goliath.</span></span>\n<p>If the characters establish a rapport with Ogolai, she tells them that one of her clan's warriors, a young male named Kapanuk, got separated from his hunting party during a blizzard a few days ago.

(The characters might locate Kapanuk in area X28 of Xardorok's fortress in <a href=\"https://5etools-mirror-1.github.io/adventure.html#IDRotF,13\">chapter 3</a>.)</p>\n<div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"> </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"1719\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Treasure.</span></span>\n<p>Ogolai's cloak has the magical properties of a @Item[sAmkNs26l3XOcN2d]{cloak of protection}.</p>\n<div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"> </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"1720\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Well.</span></span>\n<p>The main source of clean water for the clan is the well.

Sikki-kree crashed in the mountains when she was caught in a blizzard and was rescued by goliath hunters. Aruk has been nursing the aarakocra back to health, but he can do only so much. Although Sikki-kree's minor wounds have healed, she has a broken wing that requires at least 10 hit points of magical healing to be mended. The goliaths of Wyrmdoom Crag have no such magic at their disposal. Any character who helps Sikki-kree regain her ability to fly earns the aarakocra's gratitude and the respect of the Wyrmdoom goliaths.</p>\n<p>Once Sikki-kree can fly again, she thanks the characters for their help before getting Ogolai's permission to depart.
