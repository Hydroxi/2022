Slavery had forever changed them, however, darkening their spirits to make the duergar as evil as the tyrants they had escaped.

goblins. An elf behind her, clad in studded leather armor, peppers the goblins with arrows loosed from his exquisite bow. The half-orc nearby shouts orders, helping the two combatants coordinate their assault to the best advantage.</p><p>A dwarf in chain mail interposes his shield between the ogre's club and his companion, knocking the deadly blow aside. His companion, a half-elf in scale armor, swings two scimitars in a blinding whirl as she circles the ogre, looking for a blind spot in its defenses.</p><p>A gladiator fights for sport in an arena, a master with his trident and net, skilled at toppling foes and moving them around for the crowd's delight—and his own tactical advantage. His opponent's sword flares with blue light an instant before she sends lightning flashing forth to smite him.</p><p>All of these heroes are fighters, perhaps the most diverse class of characters in the worlds of Dungeons &amp; Dragons. Questing knights, conquering overlords, royal champions, elite foot soldiers, hardened mercenaries, and bandit kings—as fighters, they all share an unparalleled mastery with weapons and armor, and a thorough knowledge of the skills of combat. And they are well acquainted with death, both meting it out and staring it defiantly in the face.</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"249\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Well-Rounded Specialists</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></span> <p>Fighters learn the basics of all combat styles. Every fighter can swing an axe, fence with a rapier, wield a longsword or a greatsword, use a bow, and even trap foes in a net with some degree of skill. Likewise, a fighter is adept with shields and every form of armor. Beyond that basic degree of familiarity, each fighter specializes in a certain style of combat. Some concentrate on archery, some on fighting with two weapons at once, and some on augmenting their martial skills with magic. This combination of broad general ability and extensive specialization makes fighters superior combatants on battlefields and in dungeons alike.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"250\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Trained for Danger</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></span> <p>Not every member of the city watch, the village militia, or the queen's army is a fighter. Most of these troops are relatively untrained soldiers with only the most basic combat knowledge.

The dungeon delving, monster slaying, and other dangerous work common among adventurers is second nature for a fighter, not all that different from the life he or she left behind. There are greater risks, perhaps, but also much greater rewards—few fighters in the city watch have the opportunity to discover a magic flame tongue sword, for example.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"251\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Creating a Fighter</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></span> <p>As you build your fighter, think about two related elements of your character's background: Where did you get your combat training, and what set you apart from the mundane warriors around you? Were you particularly ruthless? Did you get extra help from a mentor, perhaps because of your exceptional dedication? What drove you to this training in the first place? A threat to your homeland, a thirst for revenge, or a need to prove yourself might all have been factors.</p><p>You might have enjoyed formal training in a noble's army or in a local militia. Perhaps you trained in a war academy, learning strategy, tactics, and military history. Or you might be self-taught—unpolished but well tested. Did you take up the sword as a way to escape the limits of life on a farm, or are you following a proud family tradition? Where did you acquire your weapons and armor? They might have been military issue or family heirlooms, or perhaps you scrimped and saved for years to buy them. Your armaments are now among your most important possessions—the only things that stand between you and death's embrace.</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"252\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Quick Build</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></span> <p>You can make a fighter quickly by following these suggestions.

looking, a human stalks alone through the shadows of trees, hunting the orcs he knows are planning a raid on a nearby farm. Clutching a shortsword in each hand, he becomes a whirlwind of steel, cutting down one enemy after another.</p><p>After tumbling away from a cone of freezing air, an elf finds her feet and draws back her bow to loose an arrow at the white dragon. Shrugging off the wave of fear that emanates from the dragon like the cold of its breath, she sends one arrow after another to find the gaps between the dragon's thick scales.</p><p>Holding his hand high, a half-elf whistles to the hawk that circles high above him, calling the bird back to his side.

They learn to track their quarry as a predator does, moving stealthily through the wilds and hiding themselves in brush and rubble. Rangers focus their combat training on techniques that are particularly useful against their specific favored foes.</p><p>Thanks to their familiarity with the wilds, rangers acquire the ability to cast spells that harness nature's power, much as a druid does. Their spells, like their combat abilities, emphasize speed, stealth, and the hunt. A ranger's talents and abilities are honed with deadly focus on the grim task of protecting the borderlands.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"6\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Independent Adventurers</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></span> <p>Though a ranger might make a living as a hunter, a guide, or a tracker, a ranger's true calling is to defend the outskirts of civilization from the ravages of monsters and humanoid hordes that press in from the wild. In some places, rangers gather in secretive orders or join forces with druidic circles. Many rangers, though, are independent almost to a fault, knowing that, when a dragon or a band of orcs attacks, a ranger might be the first—and possibly the last—line of defense.</p><p>This fierce independence makes rangers well suited to adventuring, since they are accustomed to life far from the comforts of a dry bed and a hot bath. Faced with city-bred adventurers who grouse and whine about the hardships of the wild, rangers respond with some mixture of amusement, frustration, and compassion. But they quickly learn that other adventurers who can carry their own weight in a fight against civilization's foes are worth any extra burden. Coddled city folk might not know how to feed themselves or find fresh water in the wild, but they make up for it in other ways.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"7\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Creating a Ranger</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></span> <p>As you create your ranger character, consider the nature of the training that gave you your particular capabilities. Did you train with a single mentor, wandering the wilds together until you mastered the ranger's ways? Did you leave your apprenticeship, or was your mentor slain—perhaps by the same kind of monster that became your favored enemy? Or perhaps you learned your skills as part of a band of rangers affiliated with a druidic circle, trained in mystic paths as well as wilderness lore. You might be self-taught, a recluse who learned combat skills, tracking, and even a magical connection to nature through the necessity of surviving in the wilds.</p><p>What's the source of your particular hatred of a certain kind of enemy? Did a monster kill someone you loved or destroy your home village? Or did you see too much of the destruction these monsters cause and commit yourself to reining in their depredations? Is your adventuring career a continuation of your work in protecting the borderlands, or a significant change? What made you join up with a band of adventurers?

Clutching a shortsword in each hand, he becomes a whirlwind of steel, cutting down one enemy after another.</p><p>After tumbling away from a cone of freezing air, an elf finds her feet and draws back her bow to loose an arrow at the white dragon. Shrugging off the wave of fear that emanates from the dragon like the cold of its breath, she sends one arrow after another to find the gaps between the dragon's thick scales.</p><p>Holding his hand high, a half-elf whistles to the hawk that circles high above him, calling the bird back to his side. Whispering instructions in Elvish, he points to the owlbear he's been tracking and sends the hawk to distract the creature while he readies his bow.</p><p>Far from the bustle of cities and towns, past the hedges that shelter the most distant farms from the terrors of the wild, amid the dense-packed trees of trackless forests and across wide and empty plains, rangers keep their unending watch.</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"55\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Deadly Hunters</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></span> <p>Warriors of the wilderness, rangers specialize in hunting the monsters that threaten the edges of civilization—humanoid raiders, rampaging beasts and monstrosities, terrible giants, and deadly dragons. They learn to track their quarry as a predator does, moving stealthily through the wilds and hiding themselves in brush and rubble. Rangers focus their combat training on techniques that are particularly useful against their specific favored foes.</p><p>Thanks to their familiarity with the wilds, rangers acquire the ability to cast spells that harness nature's power, much as a druid does. Their spells, like their combat abilities, emphasize speed, stealth, and the hunt. A ranger's talents and abilities are honed with deadly focus on the grim task of protecting the borderlands.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"56\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Independent Adventurers</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></span> <p>Though a ranger might make a living as a hunter, a guide, or a tracker, a ranger's true calling is to defend the outskirts of civilization from the ravages of monsters and humanoid hordes that press in from the wild. In some places, rangers gather in secretive orders or join forces with druidic circles. Many rangers, though, are independent almost to a fault, knowing that, when a dragon or a band of orcs attacks, a ranger might be the first—and possibly the last—line of defense.</p><p>This fierce independence makes rangers well suited to adventuring, since they are accustomed to life far from the comforts of a dry bed and a hot bath. Faced with city-bred adventurers who grouse and whine about the hardships of the wild, rangers respond with some mixture of amusement, frustration, and compassion. But they quickly learn that other adventurers who can carry their own weight in a fight against civilization's foes are worth any extra burden. Coddled city folk might not know how to feed themselves or find fresh water in the wild, but they make up for it in other ways.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"57\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Creating a Ranger</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></span> <p>As you create your ranger character, consider the nature of the training that gave you your particular capabilities. Did you train with a single mentor, wandering the wilds together until you mastered the ranger's ways? Did you leave your apprenticeship, or was your mentor slain—perhaps by the same kind of monster that became your favored enemy? Or perhaps you learned your skills as part of a band of rangers affiliated with a druidic circle, trained in mystic paths as well as wilderness lore. You might be self-taught, a recluse who learned combat skills, tracking, and even a magical connection to nature through the necessity of surviving in the wilds.</p><p>What's the source of your particular hatred of a certain kind of enemy? Did a monster kill someone you loved or destroy your home village? Or did you see too much of the destruction these monsters cause and commit yourself to reining in their depredations? Is your adventuring career a continuation of your work in protecting the borderlands, or a significant change? What made you join up with a band of adventurers? Do you find it challenging to teach new allies the ways of the wild, or do you welcome the relief from solitude that they offer?</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"58\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Quick Build</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></span> <p>You can make a ranger quickly by following these suggestions.

curled on his shoulder, a young elf in golden robes smiles warmly, weaving a magical charm into his honeyed words and bending the palace sentinel to his will.</p><p>As flames spring to life in her hands, a wizened human whispers the secret name of her demonic patron, infusing her spell with fiendish magic.</p><p>Shifting his gaze between a battered tome and the odd alignment of the stars overhead, a wild-eyed tiefling chants the mystic ritual that will open a doorway to a distant world.</p><p>Warlocks are seekers of the knowledge that lies hidden in the fabric of the multiverse. Through pacts made with mysterious beings of supernatural power, warlocks unlock magical effects both subtle and spectacular. Drawing on the ancient knowledge of beings such as fey nobles, demons, devils, hags, and alien entities of the Far Realm, warlocks piece together arcane secrets to bolster their own power.</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"16\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Sworn and Beholden</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></span> <p>A warlock is defined by a pact with an otherworldly being. Sometimes the relationship between warlock and patron is like that of a cleric and a deity, though the beings that serve as patrons for warlocks are not gods. A warlock might lead a cult dedicated to a demon prince, an archdevil, or an utterly alien entity—beings not typically served by clerics. More often, though, the arrangement is similar to that between a master and an apprentice. The warlock learns and grows in power, at the cost of occasional services performed on the patron's behalf.</p><p>The magic bestowed on a warlock ranges from minor but lasting alterations to the warlock's being (such as the ability to see in darkness or to read any language) to access to powerful spells. Unlike bookish wizards, warlocks supplement their magic with some facility at hand-to-hand combat. They are comfortable in light armor and know how to use simple weapons.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"17\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Delvers into Secrets</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></span> <p>Warlocks are driven by an insatiable need for knowledge and power, which compels them into their pacts and shapes their lives. This thirst drives warlocks into their pacts and shapes their later careers as well.</p><p>Stories of warlocks binding themselves to fiends are widely known. But many warlocks serve patrons that are not fiendish. Sometimes a traveler in the wilds comes to a strangely beautiful tower, meets its fey lord or lady, and stumbles into a pact without being fully aware of it. And sometimes, while poring over tomes of forbidden lore, a brilliant but crazed student's mind is opened to realities beyond the material world and to the alien beings that dwell in the outer void.</p><p>Once a pact is made, a warlock's thirst for knowledge and power can't be slaked with mere study and research. No one makes a pact with such a mighty patron if he or she doesn't intend to use the power thus gained. Rather, the vast majority of warlocks spend their days in active pursuit of their goals, which typically means some kind of adventuring. Furthermore, the demands of their patrons drive warlocks toward adventure.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"18\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Creating a Warlock</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></span> <p>As you make your warlock character, spend some time thinking about your patron and the obligations that your pact imposes upon you. What led you to make the pact, and how did you make contact with your patron? Were you seduced into summoning a devil, or did you seek out the ritual that would allow you to make contact with an alien elder god? Did you search for your patron, or did your patron find and choose you? Do you chafe under the obligations of your pact or serve joyfully in anticipation of the rewards promised to you?</p><p>Work with your DM to determine how big a part your pact will play in your character's adventuring career. Your patron's demands might drive you into adventures, or they might consist entirely of small favors you can do between adventures.</p><p>What kind of relationship do you have with your patron? Is it friendly, antagonistic, uneasy, or romantic? How important does your patron consider you to be? What part do you play in your patron's plans? Do you know other servants of your patron?</p><p>How does your patron communicate with you? If you have a familiar, it might occasionally speak with your patron's voice. Some warlocks find messages from their patrons etched on trees, mingled among tea leaves, or adrift in the clouds—messages that only the warlock can see. Other warlocks converse with their patrons in dreams or waking visions, or deal only with intermediaries.</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"19\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Quick Build</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></span> <p>You can make a warlock quickly by following these suggestions.

Jahr von meinem <strong>Vater Bertram </strong>im Neverwinter-Wald gefunden worden.</p>\n<p>Er nahm mich mit nach Hause nach <strong>Luskan </strong>und zog mich gemeinsam mit meiner <strong>Mutter Oriel </strong>groß. Später kamen noch drei leibliche Geschwister dazu.<br />Durch den sehr gut laufenden Familienbetrieb (in dem alle Familienmitglieder bis auf Ida arbeiteten) hatte es uns nie an etwas gemangelt. Ich bin als normaler Junge in einer großen Villa und mit vielen Freunden inmitten der Stadt großgeworden. Alles war idyllisch und perfekt!</p>\n<p>Doch vor 12 Jahren kam ein mysteriöser alter Mann in den Laden und suchte nach einer ganz besonderen Zutat namens \"Latha\", die Blätter eines speziellen kugeligen Busches.</p>\n<p>Die Blätter bewirken eine enorme Steigerung der Abwehrkräfte. Jedoch wurde bisher keine Methode gefunden, diese Wirkung über längere Zeit zu bewahren. <br />Der alte Mann jedoch behauptete, dass er eine Verfahren entwickelt hat dies zu ermöglichen. Dieses Geheimnis würde er mit uns teilen wenn wir ihm diese raren Blätter bringen würden.</p>\n<p>Der Busch jedoch wachse nur im Trollbark Forest, einem circa 1500km (ca. 30 Tage zu Pferde) entfernten Ort.<br />Beflügelt von der Möglichkeit einen Trank dieser Güte anbieten zu können, machten sich mein Vater, mein Bruder und ich auf den Weg in Richtung Trollbark Forest.</p>\n<p>Die Reise war geprägt von wahrlich wundervollen Landschaften, Abenteuern und viel Zeit zum Reden. Diese Reise stärkte das Band zwischen meinem Vater, Bruder und mir nur noch weiter.</p>\n<p>Nach einer beschwerlichen Reise von 29 Tagen sind wir glücklich und erschöpft im <strong>Trollbark Forest </strong>angekommen. Wir suchten nach einer geeigneten Stelle für ein Lager im sonst sumpfigen und dornigen Wald. Als wir diese schließlich am Rande eines Sumpfes gefunden haben, schlugen wir dort unser Lager auf und erholten und von der anstrengenden Reise. Es dauerte nicht lange bis wir alle einschliefen. </p>\n<p>Die Nacht wird mir jedoch immer in Erinnerung bleiben! Inmitten der Nacht wurden wir von einer Horde Trolle überfallen. Wir sind in mehrere Richtungen geflohen, woraufhin ich mich im dunklen Wald verlief. Drei Tage und Nächte irrte ich planlos und meinen Vater und Bruder suchend durch den sumpfigen Wald, immer die Trolle im Hinterkopf, ohne auch nur eine Spur der beiden zu finden. Nach einer Woche quälenden suchens musste ich mir ausgehungert und erschöpft selbst gestehen, dass es keinen Sinn hat hier weiter nach Ihnen zu suchen. Vielleicht sind sie bereits zurück nach Luskan. Nach erneut beschwerlicher und dieses Mal keiner idyllischen Reise in Luskan angekommen, fand sich jedoch keine Spur der beiden. <br /><br />Zu Hause berichtete ich meiner Mutter und Schwestern vom Verlust meines Vaters und Olof. Nach mehreren Wochen vergebenen wartens verfiel Mutter in tiefe Trauer. Psychisch unfähig den Laden zu führen, übernahmen meine kleinste Schwester Mary und ich den Laden für meine Mutter. Es fehlte uns jedoch das geballte Wissen unserer Eltern, was nach der Zeit unumgänglich dazu führte, dass wir gerade so den Laden erhalten konnten. Aus finanzieller Not heraus kam ich mit einigen düsteren Gestalten der Unterwelt in Kontakt. Es kam durch diverse Gaunereien genügend Geld zusammen, um den Laden und unser finanzielles Überleben zu sichern. Stück für Stück rutschte ich in die Unterwelt ein, war kaum noch im Laden. Dies blieb meiner Mutter nicht verborgen, und so stellte sie mich zur Rede und fragte wo ich das ganze Geld herbekam. Da ich keine Geheimnisse vor Mutter habe, antwortete ich ihr in erhlicher Manier. Diese Beichte brachte Sie jedoch nur dazu noch tiefer in Trauer zu versinken, da sie sich jetzt auch die Schuld an meinem Werdegang gab. Nach zwölf Jahren des leidens wurde mir bewusst, dass der einzige Weg meiner Mutter zu helfen war, das ursprüngliche Problem, den Verlust meines Vaters und Bruders, zu lösen. Und so schwor ich mir die beiden zu finden - lebend oder tot. Meine Mutter brauchte eine Gewissheit.</p>\n<p>Also nahm ich mir unser letztes Pferd und machte mich erneut auf den Weg zurück zum Ort an dem ich Vater und Olof das letzte Mal sah. Am Ziel angekommen, erreichte ich nach mehrtägigem durchsuchen der Wälder einen schrecklichen Ort namens \"<strong>Warlock's Crypt</strong>\". Eine Stadt voller Zerstörung, Untoter und Bosheit. Mit schrecklichen, hoch aufragenden Türmen, welche wie in die Luft ragende große Klauen aussahen. Mir fiel ein mit Lianen bedecktes Loch im Boden nahe eines Turms auf – es schien eine Art altertümlicher unterirdischer Altar gewesen zu sein.</p>\n<p>In der Hoffnung durch ein Gebet die Gnade der Götter (welcher auch immer) zu erhalten und meinen Vater und Bruder wieder zu finden, kletterte ich mithilfe der Lianen das Loch hinunter. Beim betreten des Altarraums und bevor ich überhaupt ein Gebet sprechen konnte, sprach eine Stimme zu mir. Eine weibliche, wohlklingende Stimme. Sie kam mir doch so vertraut vor obwohl ich mir sicher war, sie noch nie gehört zu haben. Die Stimme gab sich als <strong>Raven Queen </strong>aus.</p>\n<p>Wir müssen uns mehrere Stunden unterhalten haben, ich kann es nicht mehr genau sagen. Die Zeit schien auf wundersame Weise zu schwinden. Ich erzählte ihr jedes Detail meines Lebens obwohl ich Sie nicht kannte - sie kam mir eben so vertraut vor und es tat gut sich alles von der Seele zu reden. Sie hörte gespannt meiner kompletten Geschichte voller Ängste und Schmerzen zu. Daraufhin bot sie mir ihre Hilfe sowie neue Kräfte, die mir dabei helfen könnten Vater und Olof zu finden und zu retten. Für das Versprechen, mit ihr einen Pakt einzugehen. Ich meine, was hatte ich zu verlieren - ich ging natürlich auf den Pakt ein. Neue, bisher ungeahnte Fähigkeiten durchströmten meinen Körper - <strong>aus mir wurde ein Warlock</strong>.</p>\n<p>Raven Queen zeigte mir auf einer Karte den Ort, an dem Trolle die beiden angeblich als Sklaven hielten und sagte nur \"Warte auf mein Zeichen wenn du dort ankommst\". Dort angekommen sah ich nach ausgiebiger Beobachtung des Trolllagers meinen <strong>Vater und Olof - gefangen in Käfigen</strong>. Bewacht von einer großen Horde Trolle sah ich keine Möglichkeit sie zu befreien. Doch ich wartete auf das versprochene Zeichen der Raven Queen, welches auch schon in der Dämmerung kam - ein lauter Knall und Schreie in Richtung der Türme. Das Interesse der Trolle war geweckt und so stürmten alle los in Richtung der Türme. Lediglich zwei Wachen blieben zurück um auf das Lager und die Sklaven aufzupassen - noch immer zu viele für mich um damit fertig zu werden. Doch gerade als ich den Kopf in den Sand stecken wollte, kam eine Schar Krähen angeflogen und attackierten die zwei Wachtrolle. Das war das Ablenkungsmanöver das ich benötigte. Auf leisen Sohlen schlich ich mich vorbei an den Wachen und befreite Vater und Olof aus den Käfigen und den Fängen der Trolle. Sie sahen schrecklich aus! Aber immerhin lebten Sie noch. Wir schlichen uns zurück zum Lager und reisten schnellstmöglich zurück nach Luskan.</p>\n<p>Als meine Mutter uns drei sah, brach sie in Tränen aus. In den kommenden Wochen sah man förmlich wie die Schmerzen der letzten 12 Jahre aus ihrem Gesicht verschwanden. Mein Vater und Olof ging es ebanfalls zunehmend besser und sie lebten sich schnell wieder ein. Der Laden wurde schließlich wieder von Vater und Mutter übernommen und erglänzte bald wieder in ursprünglichem Glanz. Alles schien sich zum guten zu wenden.</p>\n<p>Doch ich war nicht mehr der selbe. Ich fühlte, dass die Ferne und Abenteuer nach mir riefen. Ich wurde im Laden nicht mehr zwingend gebraucht. So manches Mal davon getrieben anderen Familien diesen Schmerz zu ersparen, ein anderes Mal davon alles zu vernichten was mir in die Quere kommt um der Raven Queen so meinen Tribut in Form von Seelen zu zollen. Und so machte ich mich mit meiner leicht gespaltenen Persönlichkeit auf den Weg... auf in ein Abenteuer... auf in Richtung Icewind Dale. <br /><br /><br />MUTTER ORIEL (50 Jahre):<br />Menschliche Magierin.</p>\n<p>Besitzt innerhalb der Stadt <strong>Luskan </strong>einen damals sehr erfolgreichen Kräuter- und Zauberladen.</p>\n<p>Eine sehr hingabevolle Mutter für mich und meine Geschwister.</p>\n<p>Sie lebt und ist wieder bei bester Gesundheit.<br /><br /><br />VATER BERTRAM (51 Jahre):<br />Menschlicher Ranger</p>\n<p>Jagt und Sammelt Zutaten für den Kräuterladen.</p>\n<p>Ebenfalls ein sehr hingabevoller Vater.</p>\n<p>Vor 12 Jahren verschollen, Vor kurzem zurückgekehrt.<br /><br /><br />SCHWESTER IDA (29):<br />Menschliche Bardin</p>\n<p>Recht erfolgreiche und bekannte Musikerin.</p>\n<p>Immer ein gutes Verhältnis mit ihr gehabt.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>SCHWESTER MARY (26):<br />Menschliche Magierin</p>\n<p>Hilft meiner Mutter im Laden.</p>\n<p>Gutes Verhältnis mit ihr<br /><br /><br />BRUDER OLOF (32):<br />Menschlicher Ranger</p>\n<p>Jagt und sammelt zusammen mit meinem Vater Zutaten für den Kräuterladen.</p>\n<p>Vor 12 Jahren verschollen, Vor kurzem zurückgekehrt.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></p>","public":""},"alignment":"Chaotic Neutral","race":"Human (Variant)","background":"Criminal","originalClass":"tXt5Y3rhckrXPEii","xp":{"value":6500,"min":0,"max":14000,"pct":0},"appearance":"<p>Normal gebauter Mann mit guter Haltung.

Hailing from roots similar to antelope and sheep, the goat has become a mainstay in the world of domesticated farm animals. Goats resemble something of a shorn sheep with thick, bristle-like fur and small hooves adorning their nimble feet. Atop the goat’s head rests a set of hard horns which, depending upon the species, can vary from short and knobby to long curled protrusions. The goats use their horns for both defense and contests of strength between fellow males (or billies) during spectacular ramming matches. The clattering of mountain goats’ horns can be heard clearly throughout the valley towns during the creature’s mating seasons.</p>\n<p><strong>Of Evil and Garbage.</strong> Goats can be called nothing if not resourceful when it comes to what they choose to ingest. Goats will typically feed upon grass and weeds found in their favored open fields; however, several shepherds have noted their goats eating such objects as iron nails, bits of discarded clothing, and even the wheels of a wagon! The image of a goat has also been co opted by some of the more nefarious of our realm as a symbol of evil to represent various foul cults. Perhaps it is the goat’s sinister horizontal pupil that elicits fear in onlookers or their common use by some cultures as a ritualistic sacrifice that drives the cults to utilize their visage.

down a curse upon the forces of undeath, a human lifts her holy symbol as light pours from it to drive back the zombies crowding in on her companions.</p><p>Clerics are intermediaries between the mortal world and the distant planes of the gods. As varied as the gods they serve, clerics strive to embody the handiwork of their deities.

Clerics are conduits for that power, manifesting it as miraculous effects. The gods don't grant this power to everyone who seeks it, but only to those chosen to fulfill a high calling.</p><p>Harnessing divine magic doesn't rely on study or training. A cleric might learn formulaic prayers and ancient rites, but the ability to cast cleric spells relies on devotion and an intuitive sense of a deity's wishes.</p><p>Clerics combine the helpful magic of healing and inspiring their allies with spells that harm and hinder foes. They can provoke awe and dread, lay curses of plague or poison, and even call down flames from heaven to consume their enemies. For those evildoers who will benefit most from a mace to the head, clerics depend on their combat training to let them wade into melee with the power of the gods on their side.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"9\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Divine Agents</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></span> <p>Not every acolyte or officiant at a temple or shrine is a cleric. Some priests are called to a simple life of temple service, carrying out their gods' will through prayer and sacrifice, not by magic and strength of arms. In some cities, priesthood amounts to a political office, viewed as a stepping stone to higher positions of authority and involving no communion with a god at all. True clerics are rare in most hierarchies.</p><p>When a cleric takes up an adventuring life, it is usually because his or her god demands it. Pursuing the goals of the gods often involves braving dangers beyond the walls of civilization, smiting evil or seeking holy relics in ancient tombs. Many clerics are also expected to protect their deities' worshipers, which can mean fighting rampaging orcs, negotiating peace between warring nations, or sealing a portal that would allow a demon prince to enter the world.</p><p>Most adventuring clerics maintain some connection to established temples and orders of their faiths. A temple might ask for a cleric's aid, or a high priest might be in a position to demand it.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"10\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Creating a Cleric</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></span> <p>As you create a cleric, the most important question to consider is which deity to serve and what principles you want your character to embody.

It might be information that would be damaging to the people who or consigned you to exile, and hence the reason for your return to society.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div><p>Work with your DM to determine the details of your discovery and its impact on the campaign.</p></div>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"PHB","activation":{"type":"","cost":0,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"target":{"value":null,"width":null,"units":"","type":""},"range":{"value":null,"long":null,"units":""},"uses":{"value":0,"max":"0","per":null,"recovery":""},"consume":{"type":null,"target":null,"amount":null},"ability":"","actionType":"other","attackBonus":null,"chatFlavor":"","critical":{"threshold":null,"damage":""},"damage":{"parts":[],"versatile":""},"formula":"","save":{"ability":"","dc":null,"scaling":"flat"},"requirements":"","recharge":{"value":null,"charged":false}},"ownership":{"default":0,"GtfthjDLT8452NQj":3},"_stats":{"systemId":null,"systemVersion":null,"coreVersion":null,"createdTime":null,"modifiedTime":null,"lastModifiedBy":null}},{"_id":"zKefNg632m3Jez6a","name":"Winter Blanket","type":"loot","img":"icons/sundries/flags/banner-worn-green.webp","effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":300000,"flags":{"srd5e":{"page":"items.html","source":"PHB","hash":"blanket_phb"}},"system":{"description":{"value":"\n\t\t","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"PHB","quantity":1,"weight":3,"price":0.5,"attunement":0,"equipped":true,"rarity":"","identified":false,"damage":{"parts":[]},"proficient":true,"consume":{"type":"","target":"","amount":null},"range":{"value":5,"long":0,"units":"ft"},"critical":{"threshold":null,"damage":null}},"ownership":{"default":0,"GtfthjDLT8452NQj":3},"_stats":{"systemId":null,"systemVersion":null,"coreVersion":null,"createdTime":null,"modifiedTime":null,"lastModifiedBy":null}},{"_id":"HKJvgpKmCHr3n9Ca","name":"Common Clothes","type":"equipment","img":"icons/equipment/chest/shirt-collared-brown.webp","effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"flags":{"srd5e":{"page":"items.html","source":"PHB","hash":"common%20clothes_phb"}},"system":{"description":{"value":"\n\t\t","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"PHB","quantity":1,"weight":3,"price":0.5,"attunement":0,"equipped":false,"rarity":"","identified":false,"activation":{"type":"none","cost":0,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"target":{"value":null,"width":null,"units":"","type":""},"range":{"value":5,"long":0,"units":"ft"},"uses":{"value":null,"max":"","per":"","recovery":""},"consume":{"type":"","target":"","amount":null},"ability":null,"actionType":"","attackBonus":0,"chatFlavor":"","critical":{"threshold":null,"damage":""},"damage":{"parts":[],"versatile":""},"formula":"","save":{"ability":"","dc":null,"scaling":"spell"},"armor":{"value":null,"type":"clothing","dex":null},"hp":{"value":0,"max":0,"dt":null,"conditions":""},"baseItem":"","speed":{"value":null,"conditions":""},"strength":0,"stealth":false,"proficient":true},"ownership":{"default":0,"GtfthjDLT8452NQj":3},"_stats":{"systemId":null,"systemVersion":null,"coreVersion":null,"createdTime":null,"modifiedTime":null,"lastModifiedBy":null}},{"_id":"VmrfGgIlzTu8SkY6","name":"Herbalism Kit","type":"tool","img":"icons/containers/bags/pouch-leather-green.webp","effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"flags":{"srd5e":{"page":"items.html","source":"PHB","hash":"herbalism%20kit_phb"}},"system":{"description":{"value":"\n\t\t<div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><p>This kit contains a variety of instruments such as clippers, mortar and pestle, and pouches and vials used by herbalists to create remedies and potions.

He laughs as he charges toward the frost giant who dared poach his people's elk herd.</p><p>A half-orc snarls at the latest challenger to her authority over their savage tribe, ready to break his neck with her bare hands as she did to the last six rivals.</p><p>Frothing at the mouth, a dwarf slams his helmet into the face of his drow foe, then turns to drive his armored elbow into the gut of another.</p><p>These barbarians, different as they might be, are defined by their rage: unbridled, unquenchable, and unthinking fury. More than a mere emotion, their anger is the ferocity of a cornered predator, the unrelenting assault of a storm, the churning turmoil of the sea.</p><p>For some, their rage springs from a communion with fierce animal spirits. Others draw from a roiling reservoir of anger at a world full of pain. For every barbarian, rage is a power that fuels not just a battle frenzy but also uncanny reflexes, resilience, and feats of strength.</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><h1 class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"1\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Primal Instinct</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>People of towns and cities take pride in how their civilized ways set them apart from animals, as if denying one's own nature was a mark of superiority. To a barbarian, though, civilization is no virtue, but a sign of weakness. The strong embrace their animal nature—keen instincts, primal physicality, and ferocious rage. Barbarians are uncomfortable when hedged in by walls and crowds. They thrive in the wilds of their homelands: the tundra, jungle, or grasslands where their tribes live and hunt.</p><p>Barbarians come alive in the chaos of combat. They can enter a berserk state where rage takes over, giving them superhuman strength and resilience. A barbarian can draw on this reservoir of fury only a few times without resting, but those few rages are usually sufficient to defeat whatever threats arise.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><h1 class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"2\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">A Life of Danger</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>Not every member of the tribes deemed \"barbarians\" by scions of civilized society has the barbarian class. A true barbarian among these people is as uncommon as a skilled fighter in a town, and he or she plays a similar role as a protector of the people and a leader in times of war. Life in the wild places of the world is fraught with peril: rival tribes, deadly weather, and terrifying monsters. Barbarians charge headlong into that danger so that their people don't have to.</p><p>Their courage in the face of danger makes barbarians perfectly suited for adventuring. Wandering is often a way of life for their native tribes, and the rootless life of the adventurer is little hardship for a barbarian. Some barbarians miss the close-knit family structures of the tribe, but eventually find them replaced by the bonds formed among the members of their adventuring parties.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><h1 class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"3\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Creating a Barbarian</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>When creating a barbarian character, think about where your character comes from and his or her place in the world.

Did you join forces with soldiers of those lands to face a shared threat? Did monsters or an invading horde drive you out of your homeland, making you a rootless refugee? Perhaps you were a prisoner of war, brought in chains to \"civilized\" lands and only now able to win your freedom. Or you might have been cast out from your people because of a crime you committed, a taboo you violated, or a coup that removed you from a position of authority.</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><h2 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"4\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Quick Build</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></h2> <p>You can make a barbarian quickly by following these suggestions.

The bard is a master of song, speech, and the magic they contain. Bards say that the multiverse was spoken into existence, that the words of the gods gave it shape, and that echoes of these primordial Words of Creation still resound throughout the cosmos. The music of bards is an attempt to snatch and harness those echoes, subtly woven into their spells and powers.</p><p>The greatest strength of bards is their sheer versatility. Many bards prefer to stick to the sidelines in combat, using their magic to inspire their allies and hinder their foes from a distance. But bards are capable of defending themselves in melee if necessary, using their magic to bolster their swords and armor. Their spells lean toward charms and illusions rather than blatantly destructive spells. They have a wide-ranging knowledge of many subjects and a natural aptitude that lets them do almost anything well. Bards become masters of the talents they set their minds to perfecting, from musical performance to esoteric knowledge.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"62\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Learning from Experience</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></span> <p>True bards are not common in the world. Not every minstrel singing in a tavern or jester cavorting in a royal court is a bard. Discovering the magic hidden in music requires hard study and some measure of natural talent that most troubadours and jongleurs lack. It can be hard to spot the difference between these performers and true bards, though. A bard's life is spent wandering across the land gathering lore, telling stories, and living on the gratitude of audiences, much like any other entertainer. But a depth of knowledge, a level of musical skill, and a touch of magic set bards apart from their fellows.</p><p>Only rarely do bards settle in one place for long, and their natural desire to travel—to find new tales to tell, new skills to learn, and new discoveries beyond the horizon—makes an adventuring career a natural calling. Every adventure is an opportunity to learn, practice a variety of skills, enter long-forgotten tombs, discover lost works of magic, decipher old tomes, travel to strange places, or encounter exotic creatures. Bards love to accompany heroes to witness their deeds firsthand. A bard who can tell an awe-inspiring story from personal experience earns renown among other bards. Indeed, after telling so many stories about heroes accomplishing mighty deeds, many bards take these themes to heart and assume heroic roles themselves.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"63\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Creating a Bard</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></span> <p>Bards thrive on stories, whether those stories are true or not. Your character's background and motivations are not as important as the stories that he or she tells about them. Perhaps you had a secure and mundane childhood. There's no good story to be told about that, so you might paint yourself as an orphan raised by a hag in a dismal swamp. Or your childhood might be worthy of a story. Some bards acquire their magical music through extraordinary means, including the inspiration of fey or other supernatural creatures.</p><p>Did you serve an apprenticeship, studying under a master, following the more experienced bard until you were ready to strike out on your own? Or did you attend a college where you studied bardic lore and practiced your musical magic? Perhaps you were a young runaway or orphan, befriended by a wandering bard who became your mentor. Or you might have been a spoiled noble child tutored by a master. Perhaps you stumbled into the clutches of a hag, making a bargain for a musical gift in addition to your life and freedom, but at what cost?</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"64\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Quick Build</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></span> <p>You can make a bard quickly by following these suggestions.

Er zog mit vielen Helden durch das Land, erlebte Abenteuer, beobachtete und studierte sie bei ihren Kämpfen und sang in allergrößten, wenn nicht viel zu übertriebenen Tönen von ihren Taten und Erfolgen.</p>\n<p>Doch es genügte ihm nicht. Ja er wollte selbst ein Held sein. Wollte kämpfen, Monster töten, Burgfräulein retten und vor allem - er wollte endlich Lieder über seine eigenen Heldentaten singen. Ja, er liebte die Musik, er liebte es, von den Frauen für seine lieblichen Töne angehimmelt zu werden. Doch ach wie ermüdete und frustrierte es ihn, immer über die Heldentaten der anderen zu berichten. Ja, er war ein begnadeter Musiker, und ja, die Leute beklatschten ihn wegen seiner musikalischen Fähigkeiten. Doch wäre es die Krönung, würden seine großartigen Lieder auch seine eigenen Heldentaten beinhalten. Größenwahnsinnig? Naja. Vielleicht ein wenig. Ein Großmaul? Definitiv. Ein Hitzkopf, der Gefahren nur zu gerne unter- und sich selbst überschätzte (ähnlich Han Solo?). All zu oft hatte er schon sein Leben aufs Spiel gesetzt oder ein Messer am Halse gespürt, weil er einfach mit dem Herz auf der Zunge geboren wurde. Freundlich, aber viel zu direkt.</p>\n<p>Lange Zeit zog er mit *Rodegrimm vom Blutbuchenforst* durch das Land. Ihre Beziehung war gut, und *Held* sah in Croin seinen Schützling. Croin, schon immer von Waffen und Kämpfen fasziniert, wurde von *Held* in der Hohen Kunst des Schwertkampfs ausgebildet. So lebten sie lange Zeit mit- und voneinander. *Held* brachte ihm das Kämpfen bei, Croin begleitete ihn, unterhielt ihn und besang seine Heldentaten. </p>\n<p>Eines Tages gab es einen Zwischenfall. *Held* wurde von einem Monster, welches sie im Auftrag des hiesigen Landherren töten sollten, ziemlich in die Enge getrieben. *Held*  war schon kurz davor, sein Leben zu lassen, doch Croin, mittlerweile ein versierter Führer der Klinge, tötete in einer gewagten Aktion sein erstes Monster und rettete so *Held* das Leben.</p>\n<p>*Held*, dem die ganze Angelegenheit sehr unangenehm war, verwies Croin darauf, dass er niemals ein Wort darüber verlieren dürfe, und das natürlich *Held* dieses Monster getötet hätte.</p>\n<p>Croin passte das gar nicht. Es war sein erstes selbst getötetes Monster, und natürlich wollte er selbst den Ruhm dafür einheimsen.</p>\n<p>Ein Wilder streit entbrannte, die beiden begannen zu rangeln und Croin stieß *Held* unbeabsichtigt über eine Klippe. *Held* brach sich das Genick und starb.</p>\n<p>Welch Schande und Schmach sollte nun über Croin hereinbrechen. *Held* war nicht nur sein Ausbilder und Vorbild, er war sein Freund, eine Vaterfigur. Würden die Menschen erfahren, dass ER für den Tod von *Held* verantwortlich war, sie würden ihn erhängen.</p>\n<p>Also bemächtige sich Croin *Helds* Waffen, Rüstung und Ausrüstung, nahm *Helds* Medallion an sich (Andenken), beerdigte ihn unter einem Haufen Steinen und kehrte mit dem Kopf des Monsters zurück.  Er verkündete, dass er mit *Held* Seite an Seite gegen das Monster gekämpft hatte, er noch versuchte *Held* das Leben zu retten, ihm dies jedoch misslang, er aber noch mit letzter Kraft das Monster töten konnte. Und so schrieb er sein bisher traurigstes und bis zum heutigen Tage populärstes Lied. Und somit auch sein erstes Lied, in dem er seine eigenen Heldentaten besang. Zurecht, aber auch zu unrecht.

rhythmic rustle of leaves, knotted roots dragging through the undergrowth, and vacant holes left in the earth are all signs of this fascinating little creature. These formerly average forest plants are gifted with mild sentience by the natural spellwork of a most-powerful druid who has cast the Awaken spell to birth an Awakened Shrub.</p>\n<p>The shrub itself, having negligible will of its own, then remains @JournalEntry[Charmed] to the spellcaster for thirty days, during which, the Awakened Shrub serves at the whim of the druid. The leafy automaton is also given the ability to move independently by the spellwork cast upon it. Using their roots and branches to propel themselves across the forest floor, the shrubs are left to roam clumsily throughout the druid's selected domain.</p>\n<p><strong>Druid's Little Helper. </strong>While any mage proficient enough in the arcane to produce an Awaken spell may pull these shrubs into sudden life, it is the druids of the woods who most commonly utilize the ability. A unique feature of the Awakened Shrub is its indistinguishability between itself and an average shrub when it stands completely still. The ability to camouflage themselves so thoroughly allows the Awakened Shrubs to act as sentires for a more secretive druid's hideaway.</p>\n<p>As recommended to me by a friend of the forest: be advised to utilize the shrubs in small groups as to simply overwhelm any nosey intruders. Strength in numbers is key for these simplistic shrubs as they may be easily dispatched if singled out. As the magic within the shrub allows the shrubs to speak a language known to their creator, Awakened Shrubs may also be programmed with a warning message and avoid conflict altogether. The shrubs, however, are quite inept when it comes to the completion of even the most simplistic tasks, so utilizing them in a “living alarm” capacity may be the wisest

down a curse upon the forces of undeath, a human lifts her holy symbol as light pours from it to drive back the zombies crowding in on her companions.</p><p>Clerics are intermediaries between the mortal world and the distant planes of the gods. As varied as the gods they serve, clerics strive to embody the handiwork of their deities.

Clerics are conduits for that power, manifesting it as miraculous effects. The gods don't grant this power to everyone who seeks it, but only to those chosen to fulfill a high calling.</p><p>Harnessing divine magic doesn't rely on study or training. A cleric might learn formulaic prayers and ancient rites, but the ability to cast cleric spells relies on devotion and an intuitive sense of a deity's wishes.</p><p>Clerics combine the helpful magic of healing and inspiring their allies with spells that harm and hinder foes. They can provoke awe and dread, lay curses of plague or poison, and even call down flames from heaven to consume their enemies. For those evildoers who will benefit most from a mace to the head, clerics depend on their combat training to let them wade into melee with the power of the gods on their side.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"9\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Divine Agents</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></span> <p>Not every acolyte or officiant at a temple or shrine is a cleric. Some priests are called to a simple life of temple service, carrying out their gods' will through prayer and sacrifice, not by magic and strength of arms. In some cities, priesthood amounts to a political office, viewed as a stepping stone to higher positions of authority and involving no communion with a god at all. True clerics are rare in most hierarchies.</p><p>When a cleric takes up an adventuring life, it is usually because his or her god demands it. Pursuing the goals of the gods often involves braving dangers beyond the walls of civilization, smiting evil or seeking holy relics in ancient tombs. Many clerics are also expected to protect their deities' worshipers, which can mean fighting rampaging orcs, negotiating peace between warring nations, or sealing a portal that would allow a demon prince to enter the world.</p><p>Most adventuring clerics maintain some connection to established temples and orders of their faiths. A temple might ask for a cleric's aid, or a high priest might be in a position to demand it.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"10\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Creating a Cleric</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></span> <p>As you create a cleric, the most important question to consider is which deity to serve and what principles you want your character to embody.

companions.</p><p>Chanting a song of glory, a dwarf swings his axe in wide swaths to cut through the ranks of orcs arrayed against him, shouting praise to the gods with every foe's fall.</p><p>Calling down a curse upon the forces of undeath, a human lifts her holy symbol as light pours from it to drive back the zombies crowding in on her companions.</p><p>Clerics are intermediaries between the mortal world and the distant planes of the gods. As varied as the gods they serve, clerics strive to embody the handiwork of their deities.

Clerics are conduits for that power, manifesting it as miraculous effects. The gods don't grant this power to everyone who seeks it, but only to those chosen to fulfill a high calling.</p><p>Harnessing divine magic doesn't rely on study or training. A cleric might learn formulaic prayers and ancient rites, but the ability to cast cleric spells relies on devotion and an intuitive sense of a deity's wishes.</p><p>Clerics combine the helpful magic of healing and inspiring their allies with spells that harm and hinder foes. They can provoke awe and dread, lay curses of plague or poison, and even call down flames from heaven to consume their enemies. For those evildoers who will benefit most from a mace to the head, clerics depend on their combat training to let them wade into melee with the power of the gods on their side.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"9\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Divine Agents</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></span> <p>Not every acolyte or officiant at a temple or shrine is a cleric. Some priests are called to a simple life of temple service, carrying out their gods' will through prayer and sacrifice, not by magic and strength of arms. In some cities, priesthood amounts to a political office, viewed as a stepping stone to higher positions of authority and involving no communion with a god at all. True clerics are rare in most hierarchies.</p><p>When a cleric takes up an adventuring life, it is usually because his or her god demands it. Pursuing the goals of the gods often involves braving dangers beyond the walls of civilization, smiting evil or seeking holy relics in ancient tombs. Many clerics are also expected to protect their deities' worshipers, which can mean fighting rampaging orcs, negotiating peace between warring nations, or sealing a portal that would allow a demon prince to enter the world.</p><p>Most adventuring clerics maintain some connection to established temples and orders of their faiths. A temple might ask for a cleric's aid, or a high priest might be in a position to demand it.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"10\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Creating a Cleric</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></span> <p>As you create a cleric, the most important question to consider is which deity to serve and what principles you want your character to embody.

Or did the god choose you, impelling you into service with no regard for your wishes? How do the temple priests of your faith regard you: as a champion or a troublemaker?

companions.</p><p>Chanting a song of glory, a dwarf swings his axe in wide swaths to cut through the ranks of orcs arrayed against him, shouting praise to the gods with every foe's fall.</p><p>Calling down a curse upon the forces of undeath, a human lifts her holy symbol as light pours from it to drive back the zombies crowding in on her companions.</p><p>Clerics are intermediaries between the mortal world and the distant planes of the gods. As varied as the gods they serve, clerics strive to embody the handiwork of their deities.

Clerics are conduits for that power, manifesting it as miraculous effects. The gods don't grant this power to everyone who seeks it, but only to those chosen to fulfill a high calling.</p><p>Harnessing divine magic doesn't rely on study or training. A cleric might learn formulaic prayers and ancient rites, but the ability to cast cleric spells relies on devotion and an intuitive sense of a deity's wishes.</p><p>Clerics combine the helpful magic of healing and inspiring their allies with spells that harm and hinder foes. They can provoke awe and dread, lay curses of plague or poison, and even call down flames from heaven to consume their enemies. For those evildoers who will benefit most from a mace to the head, clerics depend on their combat training to let them wade into melee with the power of the gods on their side.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"9\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Divine Agents</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></span> <p>Not every acolyte or officiant at a temple or shrine is a cleric. Some priests are called to a simple life of temple service, carrying out their gods' will through prayer and sacrifice, not by magic and strength of arms. In some cities, priesthood amounts to a political office, viewed as a stepping stone to higher positions of authority and involving no communion with a god at all. True clerics are rare in most hierarchies.</p><p>When a cleric takes up an adventuring life, it is usually because his or her god demands it. Pursuing the goals of the gods often involves braving dangers beyond the walls of civilization, smiting evil or seeking holy relics in ancient tombs. Many clerics are also expected to protect their deities' worshipers, which can mean fighting rampaging orcs, negotiating peace between warring nations, or sealing a portal that would allow a demon prince to enter the world.</p><p>Most adventuring clerics maintain some connection to established temples and orders of their faiths. A temple might ask for a cleric's aid, or a high priest might be in a position to demand it.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"10\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Creating a Cleric</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></span> <p>As you create a cleric, the most important question to consider is which deity to serve and what principles you want your character to embody.

Or did the god choose you, impelling you into service with no regard for your wishes? How do the temple priests of your faith regard you: as a champion or a troublemaker?
